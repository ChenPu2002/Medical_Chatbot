Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. An organ is in homeostasis with the physiologic stress placed on it.

B. An increase, decrease, or change in stress on an organ can result in growth adaptations.

II. HYPERPLASIA AND HYPERTROPHY

A. An increase in stress leads to an increase in organ size.

1. Occurs via an increase in the size (hypertrophy) and/or the number (hyperplasia) of cells

B. Hypertrophy involves gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of organelles.

C. Hyperplasia involves the production of new cells from stem cells.

D. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy generally occur together (e.g., uterus during pregnancy).

1.

Permanent tissues (e.g., cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and nerve), however, cannot make new cells and undergo hypertrophy only.

2.

For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1).

E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and, eventually, cancer.

1. A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not increase the risk for prostate cancer.

III. ATROPHY

A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy).

1. Occurs via a decrease in the size and number of cells

B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis.

C. Decrease in cell size occurs via ubiquitin-proteosome degradation of the cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components.

1.

In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes.

2.

Autophagy of cellular components involves generation of autophagic vacuoles. These vacuoles fuse with lysosomes whose hydrolytic enzymes breakdown cellular components.

IV. METAPLASIA

A. A change in stress on an organ leads to a change in cell type (metaplasia).

1.

Most commonly involves change of one type of surface epithelium (squamous, columnar, or urothelial) to another 2.

Metaplastic cells are better able to handle the new stress.

B. Barrett esophagus is a classic example.

pathoma.com 1.

Esophagus is normally lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium (suited to handle friction of a food bolus).

2.

Acid reflux from the stomach causes metaplasia to nonciliated, mucin-producing columnar cells (better able to handle the stress of acid, Fig. 1.2).

C. Metaplasia occurs via reprogramming ofstem cells, which then produce the new cell type.

1.

Metaplasia is reversible, in theory, with removal of the driving stressor.

2.

For example, treatment of gastroesophageal reflux may reverse Barrett esophagus.

D. Under persistent stress, metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and eventually result in cancer.

1.

For example, Barrett esophagus may progress to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

2.

A notable exception is apocrine metaplasia of breast, which carries no increased risk for cancer.

E. Vitamin A deficiency can also result in metaplasia.

1.

Vitamin A is necessary for differentiation of specialized epithelial surfaces such as the conjunctiva covering the eye.

2.

In vitamin A deficiency, the thin squamous lining of the conjunctiva undergoes metaplasia into stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium. This change is called keratomalacia (Fig. 1.3).

F. Mesenchymal (connective) tissues can also undergo metaplasia.

1. A classic example is myositis ossificans in which connective tissue within muscle changes to bone during healing after trauma (Fig. 1.4).

V. DYSPLASIA

A. Disordered cellular growth

B. Most often refers to proliferation of precancerous cells 1. For example, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents dysplasia and is a precursor to cervical cancer.

C. Often arises from longstanding pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) or metaplasia (e.g., Barrett esophagus)

D. Dysplasia is reversible, in theory, with alleviation of inciting stress.

1. Ifstress persists, dysplasia progresses to carcinoma (irreversible).

VI. APLASIA AND HYPOPLASIA

A. Aplasia is failure of cell production during embryogenesis (e.g., unilateral renal a genesis).

B. Hypoplasia is a decrease in cell production during embryogenesis, resulting in a relatively small organ (e.g., streak ovary in Turner syndrome).

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Cellular injury occurs when a stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt.

B. The likelihood ofinjury depends on the type of stress, its severity, and the type of cell affected.

1.

Neurons are highly susceptible to ischemic injury; whereas, skeletal muscle is relatively more resistant.

2.

Slowly developing ischemia (e.g., renal artery atherosclerosis) results in atrophy; whereas, acute ischemia (e.g., renal artery embolus) results in injury.

C. Common causes of cellular injury include inflammation, nutritional deficiency or excess, hypoxia, trauma, and genetic mutations.

II. HYPOXIA

A. Low oxygen delivery to tissue; important cause ofcellular injury 1.

Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation.

2.

Decreased oxygen impairs oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased ATP production.

3.

Lack of ATP (essential energy source) leads to cellular injury.

B. Causes of hypoxia include ischemia, hypoxemia, and decreased 0 2-carrying capacity of blood.

C. Ischemia is decreased blood flow through an organ. Arises with 1.

Decreased arterial perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis) 2.

Decreased venous drainage (e.g., Budd-Chiari syndrome) 3.

D. Hypoxemia is a low partial pressure ofoxygen in the blood (Pao2 < 60 mm Hg, Sao2 < 90%). Arises with 1.

2.

3.

Diffusion defect-PAo2 not able to push as much 0 2 into the blood due to a thicker diffusion barrier (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) 4.

V/Q mismatch-Blood bypasses oxygenated lung (circulation problem, e.g., right-to-left shunt), or oxygenated air cannot reach blood (ventilation problem, e.g., atelectasis).

E. Decreased 0 -carrying capacity arises with hemoglobin (Hb) loss or dysfunction.

1.

2.

Fig.1.3 Keratomalacia. (Courtesy of Fig. 1.4 Myositis Ossificans. (Reprinted with motherchildnutrition.org) permission from orthopaedia.com) i. CO binds hemoglobin more avidly than oxygen-Pao2 normal; Sao2 decreased ii. Exposures include smoke from fires and exhaust from cars or gas heaters.

iii. Classic finding is cherry-red appearance of skin.

iv. Early sign of exposure is headache; significant exposure leads to coma and death.

3. Methemoglobinemia i. Iron in heme is oxidized to FeH, which cannot bind oxygen-Pao normal; 11. Seen with oxidant stress (e.g., sulfa and nitrate drugs) or in newborns 111. Classic finding is cyanosis with chocolate-colored blood.

iv. Treatment is intravenous methylene blue, which helps reduce Fe3+ back to Fe2+ state.

III. REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE CELLULAR INJURY

A. Hypoxia impairs oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased ATP.

B. Low ATP disrupts key cellular functions including 1.

Na+-K+ pump, resulting in sodium and water buildup in the cell 2.

Ca2+ pump, resulting in Ca2+ buildup in the cytosol of the cell 3.

Aerobic glycolysis, resulting in a switch to anaerobic glycolysis. Lactic acid buildup results in low pH, which denatures proteins and precipitates DNA.

C. The initial phase of injury is reversible. The hallmark of reversible injury is cellular swelling.

1.

Cytosol swelling results in loss of microvilli and membrane blebbing.

2.

Swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) results in dissociation of ribosomes and decreased protein synthesis.

D. Eventually, the damage becomes irreversible. The hallmark of irreversible injury is membrane damage.

1. Plasma membrane damage results in i. Cytosolic enzymes leaking into the serum (e.g., cardiac troponin) ii. Additional calcium entering into the cell 2. Mitochondrial membrane damage results in i. Loss of the electron transport chain (inner mitochondrial membrane) ii. Cytochrome c leaking into cytosol (activates apoptosis) 3. Lysosome membrane damage results in hydrolytic enzymes leaking into the cytosol, which, in turn, are activated by the high intracellular calcium.

E. The end result of irreversible injury is cell death.

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. The morphologic hallmark of cell death is loss of the nucleus, which occurs via nuclear condensation (pyknosis), fragmentation (karyorrhexis), and dissolution (karyolysis).

B. The two mechanisms of cell death are necrosis and apoptosis.

II. NECROSIS

A. Death oflarge groups of cells followed by acute inflammation

B. Due to some underlying pathologic process; never physiologic

C. Divided into several types based on gross features

III. GROSS PATTERNS OF NECROSIS

A. Coagulative necrosis 1.

Necrotic tissue that remains firm (Fig. l.SA); cell shape and organ structure are preserved by coagulation of proteins, but the nucleus disappears (Fig. l.SB).

2.

Characteristic of ischemic infarction of any organ except the brain 3.

Area of infarcted tissue is often wedge-shaped (pointing to focus of vascular occlusion) and pale.

4.

Red infarction arises if blood re-enters a loosely organized tissue (e.g., pulmonary or testicular infarction, Fig. 1.6).

B. Liquefactive necrosis 1.

Necrotic tissue that becomes liquefied; enzymatic lysis of cells and protein results in liquefaction.

2.

Characteristic of i. Brain infarction-Proteolytic enzymes from microglial cells liquefy the brain.

ii. Abscess-Proteolytic enzymes from neutrophils liquefy tissue. u1. Pancreatitis-Proteolytic enzymes from pancreas liquefy parenchyma.

C. Gangrenous necrosis 1.

Coagulative necrosis that resembles mummified tissue (dry gangrene, Fig. 1.7) 2.

Characteristic of ischemia of lower limb and GI tract 3.

If superimposed infection of dead tissues occurs, then liquefactive necrosis ensues (wet gangrene).

D. Caseous necrosis 1.

Soft and friable necrotic tissue with "cottage cheese-like" appearance (Fig. 1.8) 2.

Combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis 3.

Characteristic of granulomatous inflammation due to tuberculous or fungal infection

Fig. 1.8 Caseous necrosis of lung. (Courtesy of

Fig. 1 .6 Hemorrhagic infarction of testicle. Fig. 1.7 Dry gangrene.

Yale Rosen, MD) (Courtesy of humpath.com)

E. Fat necrosis 1.

Necrotic adipose tissue with chalky-white appearance due to deposition of calcium (Fig. 1.9) 2.

Characteristic of trauma to fat (e.g., breast) and pancreatitis-mediated damage of peripancreatic fat 3.

Fatty acids released by trauma (e.g., to breast) or lipase (e.g., pancreatitis) join with calcium via a process called saponification.

i. Saponification is an example of dystrophic calcification in which calcium deposits on dead tissues. In dystrophic calcification, the necrotic tissue acts as a nidus for calcification in the setting of normal serum calcium and phosphate.

ii. Metastatic calcification, as opposed to dystrophic calcification, occurs when high serum calcium or phosphate levels lead to calcium deposition in normal tissues (e.g., hyperparathyroidism leading to nephrocalcinosis).

F. Fibrinoid necrosis 1.

Necrotic damage to blood vessel wall 2.

Leaking of proteins (including fibrin) into vessel wall results in bright pink staining of the wall microscopically (Fig. 1.10).

3.

Characteristic of malignant hypertension and vasculitis

IV. APOPTOSIS

A. Energy (ATP) -dependent, genetically programmed cell death involving single cells or small groups of cells. Examples include 1.

2.

Removal of cells during embryogenesis 3.

CDs+ T cell-mediated killing of virally infected cells

B. Morphology 1.

Dying cell shrinks, leading cytoplasm to become more eosinophilic (pink, Fig. l.ll).

2.

Nucleus condenses and fragments in an organized manner.

3.

Apoptotic bodies fa ll from the cell and are removed by macrophages; apoptosis is not followed by inflammation.

C. Apoptosis is mediated by caspases that activate proteases and endonucleases.

1.

Proteases break down the cytoskeleton.

2.

Endonucleases break down DNA.

D. Caspases are activated by multiple pathways.

1. Intrinsic mitochondrial pathway i. Cellular injury, DNA damage, or decreased hormonal stimulation leads to inactivation of Bcl2.

ii. Lack of Bcl2 allows cytochrome c to leak from the inner mitochondrial matrix into the cytoplasm and activate caspases.

Fig. 1.9 Fat necrosis of peri-pancreatic adipose Fig. 1.10 Fibrinoid necrosis of vessel. Fig. 1.11 Apoptosis. tissue. (Courtesy of humpath.com)

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death 2. Extrinsic receptor-ligand pathway i. FAS ligand binds FAS death receptor (CD95) on the target cell, activating caspases (e.g., negative selection of thymocytes in thymus).

ii. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binds TNF receptor on the target cell, activating caspases.

3. Cytotoxic CDs+ T cell-mediated pathway i. Perforins secreted by CDs+ T cell create pores in membrane of target cell.

ii. Granzyme from CDS+ T cell enters pores and activates caspases.

iii. CDs+ T-cell killing ofvirally infected cells is an example.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Free radicals are chemical species with an unpaired electron in their outer orbit.

B. Physiologic generation of free radicals occurs during oxidative phosphorylation.

1.

Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) transfers electrons to oxygen.

2.

Partial reduction of 0 2 yields superoxide (0:), hydrogen peroxide (H2O), and hydroxyl radicals ("OH).

C. Pathologic generation of free radicals arises with 1.

Ionizing radiation-water hydrolyzed to hydroxyl free radical 2.

Inflammation-NADPH oxidase generates superoxide ions during oxygendependent killing by neutrophils.

3.

Metals (e.g., copper and iron)-Fe2+ generates hydroxyl free radicals (Fenton reaction).

4.

Drugs and chemicals-P450 system of liver metabolizes drugs (e.g., acetaminophen), generating free radicals.

D. Free radicals cause cellular injury via peroxidation of lipids and oxidation of DNA and proteins; DNA damage is implicated in aging and oncogenesis.

E. Elimination of free radicals occurs via multiple mechanisms.

1.

Antioxidants (e.g., glutathione and vitamins A , C, and E) 2.

i. Superoxide dismutase (in mitochondria)-Superoxide co:) ➔ HP2 ii. Glutathione peroxidase (in mitochondria)-2GSH + free radical ➔ GS-SG and H2O iii. Catalase (in peroxisomes)-H2O2 ➔ 0 2and H2O 3.

Metal carrier proteins (e.g., transferrin and ceruloplasmin)

II. EXAMPLES OF FREE RADICAL INJURY

A. Carbon tetrachloride (CC1) 1.

Organic solvent used in the dry cleaning industry 2.

Converted to CC13 free radical by P450 system of hepatocytes 3.

Results in cell injury with swelling of RER; consequently, ribosomes detach, impairing protein synthesis.

4.

Decreased apolipoproteins lead to fatty change in the liver (Fig. 1.12).

B. Reperfusion injury 1.

Return of blood to ischemic tissue results in production ofO2-derived free radicals, which further damage tissue.

2.

Leads to a continued rise in cardiac enzymes (e.g., troponin) after reperfusion of infarcted myocardial tissue

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Amyloid is a misfolded protein that deposits in the extracellular space, thereby damaging tissues.

B. Multiple proteins can deposit as amyloid. Shared features include 1.

2.

Congo red staining and apple-green birefringence when viewed microscopically under polarized light (Fig. 1.13)

C. Deposition can be systemic or localized.

II. SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS

A. Amyloid deposition in multiple organs; divided into primary and secondary amyloidosis

B. Primary amyloidosis is systemic deposition of AL amyloid, which is derived from immunoglobulin light chain.

1. Associated with plasma cell dyscrasias (e.g., multiple myeloma)

C. Secondary amyloidosis is systemic deposition of AA amyloid, which is derived from serum amyloid-associated protein (SAA).

1.

SAA is an acute phase reactant that is increased in chronic inflammatory states, malignancy, and Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

2.

FMF is due to a dysfunction of neutrophils (autosomal recessive) and occurs in persons of Mediterranean origin.

i. Presents with episodes of fever and acute serosal inflammation (can mimic appendicitis, arthritis, or myocardial infarction) ii. High SAA during attacks deposits as AA amyloid in tissues.

D. Clinical findings of systemic amyloidosis are diverse since almost any tissue can be involved. Classic findings include 1.

Nephrotic syndrome; kidney is the most common organ involved.

2.

3.

Tongue enlargement, malabsorption, and hepatosplenomegaly

E. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. Abdominal fat pad and rectum are easily accessible biopsy targets.

F. Damaged organs must be transplanted. Amyloid cannot be removed.

III. LOCALIZED AMYLOIDOSIS

A. Amyloid deposition usually localized to a single organ.

B. Senile cardiac amyloidosis 1.

Non-mutated serum transthyretin deposits in the heart.

2.

Usually asymptomatic; present in 25% of individuals > 80 years of age

C. Familial amyloid cardiomyopathy

Growth Adaptations, Cellular Injury, and Cell Death 1.

Mutated serum transthyretin deposits in the heart leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy.

2.

5% of African Americans carry the mutated gene.

D. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II) 1. Amylin (derived from insulin) deposits in the islets of the pancreas.

E. Alzheimer disease 1.

AP amyloid (derived from P-amyloid precursor protein) deposits in the brain forming amyloid plaques.

2.

Gene for P-APP is present on chromosome 21. Most individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alzheimer disease by the age of 40 (early-onset).

F. Dialysis-associated amyloidosis 1. P2-microglobulin deposits in joints.

G. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid 1. Calcitonin (produced by tumor cells) deposits within the tumor ('tumor cells in an amyloid background').

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

I. INFLAMMATION

A. Allows inflammatory cells, plasma proteins (e.g., complement), and fluid to exit blood vessels and enter the interstitial space

B. Divided into acute and chronic inflammation

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by the presence of edema and neutrophils in tissue (Fig. 2.lA)

B. Arises in response to infection (to eliminate pathogen) or tissue necrosis (to clear necrotic debris)

C. Immediate response with limited specificity (innate immunity)

II. MEDIATORS OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION

A. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1.

Present on cells of the innate immune system (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) 2.

Activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are commonly shared by microbes i. CD14 (a co-receptor for TLR4) on macrophages recognizes lipopolysaccharide (a PAMP) on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.

3.

TLR activation results in upregulation of NF-KB, a nuclear transcription factor that activates immune response genes leading to production of multiple immune mediators.

4.

TLRs are also present on cells of adaptive immunity (e.g., lymphocytes) and, hence, play an important role in mediating chronic inflammation.

B. Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites 1. AA is released from the phospholipid cell membrane by phospholipase A2 and then acted upon by cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase.

i. Cyclooxygenase produces prostaglandins (PG).

a.

PGI2, PGD2, and PGE2 mediate vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.

b.

PGE also mediates pain and fever.

ii. 5-lipoxygenase produces leukotrienes (LT).

a.

LTB4 attracts and activates neutrophils.

b.

LTC , LTD , and LTE (slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis) mediate vasoconstriction, bronchospasm, and increased vascular permeability.

C. Mast cells 1.

2.

Activated by (1) tissue trauma, (2) complement proteins C3a and CSa, or (3) cross-linking of cell-surface IgE by antigen pathoma.com i. Immediate response involves release of preformed histamine granules, which mediate vasodilation of arterioles and increased vascular permeability.

ii. Delayed response involves production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotrienes.

D. Complement 1.

2.

Circulate as inactive precursors; activation occurs via i. Classical pathway-Cl binds IgG or IgM that is bound to antigen.

ii. Alternative pathway-Microbial products directly activate complement.

iii. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway-MEL binds to mannose on microorganisms and activates complement.

3.

All pathways result in production of C3 convertase (mediates C3 ➔ C3a and C3b), which, in turn, produces CS convertase (mediates CS ➔ CSa and CSb). CSb complexes with C6-C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC).

1. C3a and CSa (anaphylatoxins)-trigger mast cell degranulation, resulting in histamine-mediated vasodilation and increased vascular permeability ii. CSa-chemotactic for neutrophils iii. C3b-opsonin for phagocytosis iv. MAC-lyses microbes by creating a hole in the cell membrane

E. Hageman factor (Factor XII) 1.

2.

Activated upon exposure to subendothelial or tissue collagen; in turn, activates i. Coagulation and fibrinolytic systems ii. Complement iii. Kin in system-Kinin cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) to bradykinin, which mediates vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (similar to histamine), as well as pain.

III. CARDINAL SIGNS OF INFLAMMATION

A. Redness (rubor) and warmth (calor) 1.

Due to vasodilation, which results in increased blood flow 2.

Occurs via relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle; key mediators are histamine, prostaglandins, and bradykinin.

B. Swelling (tumor) 1.

Due to leakage of fluid from postcapillary venules into the interstitial space (exudate) 2.

Key mediators are (1) histamine, which causes endothelial cell contraction and (2) tissue damage, resulting in endothelial cell disruption.

C. Pain (dolor) 1. Bradykinin and PGE sensitize sensory nerve endings.

Fig. 2.1 Inflammation. A, Acute inflammation with neutrophils. B, Chronic inflammation with lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

D. Fever 1.

Pyrogens (e.g., LPS from bacteria) cause macrophages to release IL-1 and TNF, which increase cyclooxygenase activity in perivascular cells of the hypothalamus.

2.

Increased PGE2 raises temperature set point.

IV. NEUTROPHIL ARRIVAL AND FUNCTION A. Step 1-Margination 1. Vasodilation slows blood flow in postcapillary venules.

2.

Cells marginate from center of flow to the periphery. B. Step 2-Rolling 1. Selectin "speed bumps" are upregulated on endothelial cells.

i. P-selectin release from Weibel-Palade bodies is mediated by histamine.

ii. E-selectin is induced by TNF and IL-1.

2. Selectins bind sialyl Lewis X on leukocytes.

3.

Interaction results in rolling of leukocytes along vessel wall. C. Step 3-Adhesion 1.

Cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM and VCAM) are upregulated on endothelium by TNF and IL-1.

2.

Integrins are upregulated on leukocytes by C5a and LTB4 • 3.

Interaction between CA Ms and integrins results in firm adhesion ofleukocytes to the vessel wall.

4.

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is most commonly due to an autosomal recessive defect of integrins (CD18 subunit).

i. Clinical features include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, increased circulating neutrophils (due to impaired adhesion of marginated pool of leukocytes), and recurrent bacterial infections that lack pus formation.

D. Step 4-Transmigration and Chemotaxis 1.

Leukocytes transmigrate across the endothelium of postcapillary venules and move toward chemical attractants (chemotaxis).

2.

Neutrophils are attracted by bacterial products, IL-8, C5a, and LTB •

E. Step 5-Phagocytosis 1.

Consumption of pathogens or necrotic tissue; phagocytosis is enhanced by opsonins (IgG and C3b).

2.

Pseudopods extend from leukocytes to form phagosomes, which are internalized and merge with lysosomes to produce phagolysosomes.

3.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a protein trafficking defect (autosomal recessive) characterized by impaired phagolysosome formation. Clinical features include i. Increased risk of pyogenic infections ii. Neutropenia (due to intramedullary death of neutrophils) iii. Giant granules in leukocytes (due to fusion of granules arising from the Golgi apparatus) iv.

Defective primary hemostasis (due to abnormal dense granules in platelets) v.

vi. Peripheral neuropathy

F. Step 6-Destruction of phagocytosed material 1.

0 2-dependent killing is the most effective mechanism.

2.

HOC! generated by oxidative burst in phagolysosomes destroys phagocytosed microbes.

1. 0 2 is converted too; by NADPH oxidase (oxidative burst).

ii. o ; is converted to H 0 by superoxide dismutase (SOD).

iii. Hp2 is converted to HOC! (bleach) by myeloperoxidase (MPO). 3. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by poor 0 -dependent killing.

i. Due to NADPH oxidase defect (X-linked or autosomal recessive) ii. Leads to recurrent infection and granuloma formation with catalase-positive organisms, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, Serratia marcescens, Nocardia, and Aspergillus iii. Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used to screen for CGD. Leukocytes are incubated with NBT dye, which turns blue ifNADPH oxidase can convert 0 too;, but remains colorless ifNADPH oxidase is defective.

4. MPO deficiency results in defective conversion ofH 0 to HOCL i. Increased risk for Candida infections; however, most patients are asymptomatic.

ii. NBT is normal; respiratory burst (02 to Hp2) is intact.

5. 0 2-independent killing is less effective than 0 2 -dependent killing and occurs via enzymes present in leukocyte secondary granules (e.g., lysozyme in macrophages and major basic protein in eosinophils).

G. Step ?-Resolution 1. Neutrophils undergo apoptosis and disappear within 24 hours after resolution of the inflammatory stimulus.

V. MACROPHAGES

A. Macrophages predominate after neutrophils and peak 2-3 days after inflammation begins.

1. Derived from monocytes in blood

B. Arrive in tissue via the margination, rolling, adhesion, and transmigration sequence

C. Ingest organisms via phagocytosis (augmented by opsonins) and destroy phagocytosed material using enzymes (e.g., lysozyme) in secondary granules (02independent killing)

D. Manage the next step of the inflammatory process. Outcomes include 1.

Resolution and healing-Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-~) are produced by macrophages.

2.

Continued acute inflammation-marked by persistent pus formation; IL-8 from macrophages recruits additional neutrophils.

3.

Abscess-acute inflammation surrounded by fibrosis; macrophages mediate fibrosis via fibrogenic growth factors and cytokines.

4.

Chronic inflammation-Macrophages present antigen to activate CD4+ helper T cells, which secrete cytokines that promote chronic inflammation.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by the presence oflymphocytes and plasma cells in tissue (Fig. 2.lB)

B. Delayed response, but more specific (adaptive immunity) than acute inflammation

C. Stimuli include (1) persistent infection (most common cause); (2) infection with viruses, mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi; (3) autoimmune disease; (4) foreign material; and (5) some cancers.

II. T LYMPHOCYTES

A. Produced in bone marrow as progenitor T cells

B. Further develop in the thymus where the T-cell receptor (TCR) undergoes rearrangement and progenitor cells become CD4+ helper T cells or CDs+ cytotoxic T cells 1. T cells use TCR complex (TCR and CD3) for antigen surveillance.

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing 2. TCR complex recognizes antigen presented on MHC molecules.

i. CD4+ T cells-MHC class II ii. CDS+ T cells-MHC class I 3. Activation ofT cells requires (1) binding of antigen/MHC complex and (2) an additional 2nd signal.

C. CD4 + helper T-cell activation 1.

Extracellular antigen (e.g., foreign protein) is phagocytosed, processed, and presented on MHC class II, which is expressed by antigen presenting cells (APCs).

2.

B7 on APC binds CD2S on CD4+ helper T cells providing 2nd activation signal.

3.

Activated CD4 + helper T cells secrete cytokines that "help" inflammation and are divided into two subsets.

i. T Hl subset secretes IFN-y (activates macrophage, promotes B-cell class switching from IgM to IgG, promotes T1) phenotype and inhibits TH2 phenotype).

ii. TH2 subset secretes IL-4 (facilitates B-cell class switching to IgE), IL-5 (eosinophil chemotaxis and activation, and class switching to IgA), and IL-13 (function similar to IL-4).

D. CDs+ cytotoxic T-cell activation 1.

Intracellular antigen (derived from proteins in the cytoplasm) is processed and presented on MHC class I, which is expressed by all nucleated cells and platelets.

2.

IL-2 from CD4+ THl cell provides 2nd activation signal.

3.

Cytotoxic T cells are activated for killing.

4.

1. Secretion of perforin and granzyme; perforin creates pores that allow granzyme to enter the target cell, activating apoptosis.

ii. Expression of FasL, which binds Fas on target cells, activating apoptosis

III. B LYMPHOCYTES

A. Immature B cells are produced in the bone marrow and undergo immunoglobulin rearrangements to become na'ive B cells that express surface IgM and IgD.

B. B-cell activation occurs via 1.

Antigen binding by surface IgM or IgD; results in maturation to IgM-or IgDsecreting plasma cells 2.

B-cell antigen presentation to CD4+ helper T cells via MHC class II.

i. CD40 receptor on B cell binds CD40L on helper T cell, providing 2nd activation signal.

ii. Helper T cell then secretes IL-4 and IL-5 (mediate B-cell isotype switching, hypermutation, and maturation to plasma cells).

IV. GRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION

A. Subtype of chronic inflammation

B. Characterized by granuloma, which is a collection of epithelioid histiocytes (macrophages with abundant pink cytoplasm), usually surrounded by giant cells and a rim of lymphocytes

C. Divided into noncaseating and caseating subtypes 1.

Noncaseating granulomas lack central necrosis (Fig. 2.2A). Common etiologies include reaction to foreign material, sarcoidosis, beryllium exposure, Crohn disease, and cat scratch disease.

2.

Caseating granulomas exhibit central necrosis and are characteristic of tuberculosis and fungal infections (Fig. 2.2B).

D. Steps involved in granuloma formation 1.

Macrophages process and present antigen via MHC class II to CD4+ helper T cells.

2.

Interaction leads macrophages to secrete IL-12, inducing CD4+ helper T cells to differentiate into TH 1 subtype.

3.

TH 1 cells secrete IFN-y, which converts macrophages to epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells.

I. DIGEORGE SYNDROME

A. Developmental failure of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches 1. Due to 22qll microdeletion

B. Presents with T-cell deficiency (lack of thymus); hypocalcemia (lack of parathyroids); and abnormalities of heart, great vessels, and face

II. SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY (SCIO)

A. Defective cell-mediated and humoral immunity

B. Etiologies include 1.

Cytokine receptor defects-Cytokine signaling is necessary for proliferation and maturation of B and T cells.

2.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency-ADA is necessary to deaminate adenosine and deoxyadenosine for excretion as waste products; buildup of adenosine and deoxyadenosine is toxic to lymphocytes.

3.

MHC class II deficiency-MHC class II is necessary for CD4+ helper T cell activation and cytokine production.

C. Characterized by susceptibility to fungal, viral, bacterial, and protozoa! infections, including opportunistic infections and live vaccines

D. Treatment is sterile isolation ('bubble baby') and stem cell transplantation.

III. X-LINKED AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA

A. Complete lack of immunoglobulin due to disordered B-cell maturation 1. Pre-and pro-B cells cannot mature.

B. Due to mutated Bruton tyrosine kinase; X-linked

C. Presents after 6 months of life with recurrent bacterial, enterovirus (e.g., polio and coxsackievirus), and Giardia lamblia infections; maternal antibodies present during the first 6 months oflife are protective.

D. Live vaccines (e.g., polio) must be avoided.

IV. COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CVID)

A. Low immunoglobulin due to B-cell or helper T-cell defects

Fig. 2.2 Granuloma. A, Noncaseating. B, Caseating. Fig. 2.3 Angioedema. (Courtesy of James Heilman, MD, Wikipedia)

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

B. Increased risk for bacterial, enterovirus, and Giardia lamblia infections, usually in late childhood

C. Increased risk for autoimmune disease and lymphoma

V. IgA DEFICIENCY

A. Low serum and mucosa! IgA; most common immunoglobulin deficiency

B. Increased risk for mucosa! infection, especially viral; however, most patients are asymptomatic.

VI. HYPER-IgM SYNDROME

A. Characterized by elevated IgM

B. Due to mutated CD40L (on helper T cells) or CD40 receptor (on B cells) 1.

Second signal cannot be delivered to helper T cells during B-cell activation.

2.

Consequently, cytokines necessary for immunoglobulin class switching are not produced.

C. Low IgA, IgG, and IgE result in recurrent pyogenic infections (due to poor opsonization), especially at mucosa! sites.

VII. WISKOTT-ALDRICH SYNDROME

A. Characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections (defective humoral and cellular immunity); bleeding is a major cause of death

B. Due to mutation in the WASP gene; X-linked

VIII. COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIES

A. C5-C9 deficiencies-increased risk for Neisseria infection (N gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis)

B. Cl inhibitor deficiency-results in hereditary angioedema, which is characterized by edema of the skin (especially periorbital, Fig. 2.3) and mucosa! surfaces

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by immune-mediated damage of self tissues 1. US prevalence is 1%-2%.

B. Involves loss of self-tolerance 1.

Self-reactive lymphocytes are regularly generated but develop central (thymus and bone marrow) or peripheral tolerance.

2.

Central tolerance in thymus leads to T-cell (thymocyte) apoptosis or generation of regulatory T cells.

i. AIRE mutations result in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.

3.

Central tolerance in bone marrow leads to receptor editing or B-cell apoptosis.

4.

Peripheral tolerance leads to anergy or apoptosis ofT and B cells.

1. Fas apoptosis pathway mutations result in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).

5.

Regulatory T cells suppress autoimmunity by blocking T-cell activation and producing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-~).

i. CD25 polymorphisms are associated with autoimmunity (MS and type 1 DM).

ii. FOXP3 mutations lead to IPEX syndrome (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked).

C. More common in women; classically affects women ofchildbearing age 1. Estrogen may reduce apoptosis of self-reactive B cells.

D. Etiology is likely an environmental trigger in genetically-susceptible individuals.

1. Increased incidence in twins 2.

Association with certain HLA types (e.g., HLA-B27) and PTPN22 polymorphisms 3.

Environmental triggers lead to bystander activation or molecular mimicry.

E. Autoimmune disorders are clinically progressive with relapses and remissions and often show overlapping features; partially explained by epitope spreading

II. SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

A. Chronic, systemic autoimmune disease 1. Flares and remissions are common.

B. Classically arises in middle-aged females, especially African American and Hispanic women 1. May also arise in children and older adults (less dramatic gender bias)

C. Antigen-antibody complexes damage multiple tissues (type III HSR).

1.

Poorly-cleared apoptotic debris (e.g., from UV damage) activates self-reactive lymphocytes, which then produce antibodies to host nuclear antigens.

2.

Antigen-antibody complexes are generated at low levels and taken up by dendritic cells.

3.

DNA antigens activate TLRs, amplifying immune response (IFN-a).

4.

Antigen-antibody complexes are subsequently generated at higher levels and deposit in multiple tissues causing disease.

5.

Deficiency of early complement proteins (Clq, C4, and C2) is associated with SLE.

D. Almost any tissue can be involved. Classic findings include 1.

Fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and Raynaud phenomenon 2.

Malar 'butterfly' rash (Fig. 2.4A) or discoid rash (Fig. 2.4B), especially upon exposure to sunlight 3.

4.

Arthritis (usually involving ?. 2 joints) 5.

6.

7.

i. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common and most severe form of injury.

ii. Other patterns of injury (e.g., membranous glomerulonephritis) also occur.

8.

Anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia (type II HSR) 9.

10.

Antinuclear antibody (ANA; sensitive, but not specific) 11.

E. Antiphospholipid antibody is associated with SLE (one-third of patients).

1. Autoantibody directed against proteins bound to phospholipids

Fig. 2.4A Malar 'butterfly' rash, SLE. Fig. 2.4B Discoid rash, SLE.

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing 2. Important antiphospholipid antibodies include anticardiolipin (false-positive VDRL and RPR syphilis screening tests), anti-02-glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant (falsely-elevated PTT).

F. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by hypercoagulable state due to antiphospholipid antibodies (especially lupus anticoagulant).

1.

Results in arterial and venous thrombosis including deep venous, hepatic vein, placental (recurrent pregnancy loss), and cerebral (stroke) thrombosis 2.

3.

Associated with SLE; however, more commonly occurs as a primary disorder

G. Antihistone antibody is characteristic of drug-induced lupus.

1.

Procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid are common causes.

2.

ANA is positive by definition.

3.

CNS and renal involvement are rare.

4.

Removal of drug usually results in remission.

H. First-line treatment includes avoiding exposure to direct sunlight and glucocorticoids for flares; other immunosuppressive agents are useful in severe or refractory disease.

I. 5-year survival is > 90%; renal failure, infection, and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis (occurs late) are common causes of death.

III. SJOGREN SYNDROME

A. Autoimmune destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands 1. Lymphocyte-mediated damage (type IV HSR) with fibrosis

B. Classically presents as dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth (xerostomia), and recurrent dental caries in an older woman (50-60 years)-"Can't chew a cracker, dirt in my eyes" 1. May progress to ulceration of corneal epithelium and oral mucosa

C. Can be primary (sicca syndrome) or associated with another autoimmune disorder, especially rheumatoid arthritis 1. Rheumatoid factor is often present even when rheumatoid arthritis is absent.

D. Characterized by ANA and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies (anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La) 1.

Anti-SSA and anti-SSB are associated with extraglandular manifestations (e.g., neuropathy).

2.

Pregnant women with anti-SSA are at risk for delivering babies with neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.

3.

Anti-SSA and anti-SSB are also seen in a subset of patients with SLE (screen pregnant patients)

E. Lymphocytic sialadenitis on lip biopsy (minor salivary glands) is an additional diagnostic criterion (Fig. 2.4C).

F. Increased risk for B-cell (marginal zone) lymphoma, which presents as unilateral enlargement of the parotid gland late in disease course

IV. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SCLERODERMA)

A. Autoimmune disorder characterized by sclerosis of skin and visceral organs 1. Classically presents in middle-aged females (30-50 years)

B. Fibroblast activation leads to deposition of collagen.

1.

Autoimmune damage to mesenchyme is possible initiating event.

2.

Endothelial dysfunction leads to inflammation (increased adhesion molecules), vasoconstriction (increased endothelin and decreased NO), and secretion of growth factors (TGF-0 and PDGF).

3.

Fibrosis, initially perivascular, progresses and causes organ damage.

V.

I.

II.

C. Limited type-Skin involvement is limited (hands and face) with late visceral involvement.

1. Prototype is CREST syndrome: Calcinosis/anti-Centromere antibodies, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly (Fig. 2.4D), and Telangiectasias of the skin.

D. Diffuse type-Skin involvement is diffuse with early visceral involvement.

1.

Any organ can be involved.

2.

i. Vessels (Raynaud phenomenon) ii. GI tract (esophageal dysmotility and reflux) iii. Lungs (interstitial fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension) iv. Kidneys (scleroderma renal crisis) 3.

Highly associated with antibodies to DNA topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70).

A. Autoimmune-mediated tissue damage with mixed features ofSLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis

B. Characterized by ANA along with serum antibodies to Ul ribonucleoprotein

A. Healing is initiated when inflammation begins.

B. Occurs via a combination of regeneration and repair

A. Replacement of damaged tissue with native tissue; dependent on regenerative capacity of tissue

B. Tissues are divided into three types based on regenerative capacity: labile, stable, and permanent.

C. Labile tissues possess stem cells that continuously cycle to regenerate the tissue.

1.

Small and large bowel (stem cells in mucosa] crypts, Fig. 2.5) 2.

Skin (stem cells in basal layer, Fig. 2.6) 3.

D. Stable tissues are comprised of cells that are quiescent (G ), but can reenter the cell cycle to regenerate tissue when necessary.

1. Classic example is regeneration of liver by compensatory hyperplasia after partial resection. Each hepatocyte produces additional cells and then reenters quiescence.

Fig. 2.4C Lymphocytic sialadenitis, Sjogren Fig. 2.4D Sclerodactyly, scleroderma. Fig. 2.5 Intestinal crypts. syndrome.

Inflammation, Inflammatory Disorders, and Wound Healing

E. Permanent tissues lack significant regenerative potential (e.g., myocardium, skeletal muscle, and neurons).

III. REPAIR

A. Replacement of damaged tissue with fibrous scar

B. Occurs when regenerative stem cells are lost (e.g., deep skin cut) or when a tissue lacks regenerative capacity (e.g., healing after a myocardial infarction, Fig. 2.7)

C. Granulation tissue formation is the initial phase of repair (Fig. 2.8).

1. Consists of fibroblasts (deposit type III collagen), capillaries (provide nutrients), and myofibroblasts (contract wound)

D. Eventually results in scar formation, in which type III collagen is replaced with type I collagen 1.

Type III collagen is pliable and present in granulation tissue, embryonic tissue, uterus, and keloids.

2.

Type I collagen has high tensile strength and is present in skin, bone, tendons, and most organs.

3.

Collagenase removes type III collagen and requires zinc as a cofactor.

IV.

A. Mediated by paracrine signaling via growth factors (e.g., macrophages secrete growth factors that target fibroblasts)

B. Interaction of growth factors with receptors (e.g., epidermal growth factor with growth factor receptor) results in gene expression and cellular growth.

C. Examples of mediators include 1.

2.

3.

Platelet-derived growth factor-growth factor for endothelium, smooth muscle, and fibroblasts 4.

5.

V.

A. Cutaneous healing occurs via primary or secondary intention.

1.

Primary intention-Wound edges are brought together (e.g., suturing of a surgical incision); leads to minimal scar formation 2.

Secondary intention-Edges are not approximated. Granulation tissue fills the defect; myofibroblasts then contract the wound, forming a scar.

B. Delayed wound healing occurs in 1. Infection (most common cause; S aureus is the most common offender)

Fig. 2.6 Basal layer of skin. Fig. 2.7 Myocardial scarring. (Courtesy of Aliya Fig. 2.8 Granulation tissue. Husa in, MD) 2. Vitamin C, copper, or zinc deficiency i. Vitamin C is an important cofactor in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine procollagen residues; hydroxylation is necessary for eventual collagen cross-linking.

ii. Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase, which cross-links lysine and hydroxylysine to form stable collagen.

iii. Zinc is a cofactor for collagenase, which replaces the type III collagen of granulation tissue with stronger type I collagen.

3. Other causes include foreign body, ischemia, diabetes, and malnutrition.

C. Dehiscence is rupture of a wound; most commonly seen after abdominal surgery

D. Hypertrophic scar is excess production of scar tissue that is localized to the wound (Fig. 2.9).

E. Keloid is excess production of scar tissue that is out of proportion to the wound (Fig. 2.10).

1.

2.

3.

Classically affects earlobes, face, and upper extremities

Principles of Neoplasia

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neoplasia is new tissue growth that is unregulated, irreversible, and monoclonal; these features distinguish it from hyperplasia and repair.

B. Monoclonal means that the neoplastic cells are derived from a single mother cell.

C. Clonality was historically determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme isoforms.

1.

Multiple isoforms (e.g., G6PDA, G6PDB, and G6PDc) exist; only one isoform is inherited from each parent.

2.

In females, one isoform is randomly inactivated in each cell by lyonization (G6PD is present on the X chromosome).

3.

Normal ratio of active isoforms in cells of any tissue is 1:1 (e.g., 50% of cells have G6PDA, and 50% of cells have G6PD8) .

4.

1:1 ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal (cells are derived from multiple cells).

5.

Only one isoform is present in neoplasia, which is monoclonal.

6.

Clonality can also be determined by androgen receptor isoforms, which are also present on the X chromosome.

D. Clonality ofB lymphocytes is determined by immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain phenotype.

1.

lg is comprised of heavy and light chains.

2.

Each B cell expresses light chain that is either kappa or lambda.

3.

Normal kappa to lambda light chain ratio is 3:1.

4.

This ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal.

5.

Ratio increases to > 6:1 or is inverted (e.g., kappa to lambda ratio= 1:3) in lymphoma, which is monoclonal.

E. Neoplastic tumors are benign or malignant.

1.

Benign tumors remain localized and do not metastasize.

2.

Malignant tumors (cancer) invade locally and have the potential to metastasize.

F. Tumor nomenclature is based on lineage of differentiation (type of tissue produced) and whether the tumor is benign or malignant (Table 3.1).

Table 3.1: Examples of Tumor Nomenclature pathoma.com

II. EPIDEMIOLOGY

A. Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in both adults and children.

1.

The leading causes of death in adults are (1) cardiovascular disease, (2) cancer, and (3) chronic respiratory disease.

2.

The leading causes of death in children are (1) accidents, (2) cancer, and (3) congenital defects.

B. The most common cancers by incidence in adults are (1) breast/prostate, (2) lung, and (3) colorectal.

C. The most common causes of cancer mortality in adults are (1) lung, (2) breast/ prostate, and (3) colorectal.

III. ROLE OF SCREENING

A. Cancer begins as a single mutated cell.

B. Approximately 30 divisions occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise.

C. Each division (doubling time) results in increased mutations.

1.

Cancers that do not produce symptoms until late in disease will have undergone additional divisions and, hence, additional mutations.

2.

Cancers that are detected late tend to have a poor prognosis.

3.

Screening seeks to catch dysplasia (precancerous change) before it becomes carcinoma or carcinoma before clinical symptoms arise; efficacy of screening, however, requires a decrease in cancer-specific mortality.

D. Common screening methods include 1.

2.

Mammography-detects in situ breast cancer (e.g., DCIS) before it invades or invasive carcinoma before it becomes clinically palpable 3.

4.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Cancer formation is initiated by damage to DNA of stem cells. The damage overcomes DNA repair mechanisms, but is not lethal.

1. Carcinogens are agents that damage DNA, increasing the risk for cancer. Important carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses, and radiation (Table 3.2).

B. DNA mutations eventually disrupt key regulatory systems, allowing for tumor promotion (growth) and progression (spread).

1. Disrupted systems include proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and regulators of apoptosis.

II. ONCOGENES

A. Proto-oncogenes are essential for cell growth and differentiation; mutations of proto-oncogenes form oncogenes that lead to unregulated cellular growth.

B. Categories of oncogenes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducers, nuclear regulators, and cell cycle regulators (Table 3.3).

1.

Growth factors induce cellular growth (e.g., PDGFB in astrocytoma).

2.

Growth factor receptors mediate signals from growth factors (e.g., ERBB2 [HER2/neu] in breast cancer).

3.

Signal transducers relay receptor activation to the nucleus (e.g., ras).

Results in formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which are normally excised by restriction endonuclease -,--~---------FUNDAMENTALS OF PA_T_H_O_L_O_G_Y_______ 1. Ras is associated with growth factor receptors in an inactive GDP-bound state.

ii. Receptor binding causes GDP to be replaced with GTP, activating ras.

iii. Activated ras sends growth signals to the nucleus.

iv.

Ras inactivates itself by cleaving GTP to GDP; this is augmented by GTPase activating protein.

v.

Mutated ras inhibits the activity of GTPase activating protein. This prolongs the activated state of ras, resulting in increased growth signals.

4. Cell cycle regulators mediate progression through the cell cycle (e.g., cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase).

i. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) form a complex which phosphorylates proteins that drive the cell through the cell cycle.

ii. For example, the cyclinD/CDK4 complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein, which promotes progression through the G/ S checkpoint.

III. TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES

A. Regulate cell growth and, hence, decrease ("suppress") the risk of tumor formation; p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma) are classic examples.

B. p53 regulates progression of the cell cycle from G to S phase.

Table 3.3: Important Oncogenes and Associated Tumors

Carcinomas, melanoma, and

ABL Tyrosine kinase t(9;22) with BCR CML and some types of ALL

Principles of Neoplasia 1.

In response to DNA damage, p53 slows the cell cycle and upregulates DNA repair enzymes.

2.

IfDNA repair is not possible, p53 induces apoptosis.

1. p53 upregulates BAX, which disrupts Bcl2.

ii. Cytochrome c leaks from the mitochondria activating apoptosis.

3.

Both copies of the p53 gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson two-hit hypothesis).

i. Loss is seen in > 50% of cancers.

ii. Germline mutation results in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (2nd hit is somatic), characterized by the propensity to develop multiple types of carcinomas and sarcomas.

C. Rb also regulates progression from G1 to S phase.

1.

Rb "holds" the E2F transcription factor, which is necessary for transition to the S phase.

2.

E2F is released when RB is phosphorylated by the cyclinD/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) complex.

3.

Rb mutation results in constitutively free E2F, allowing progression through the cell cycle and uncontrolled growth of cells.

4.

Both copies of Rb gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson twohit hypothesis).

i. Sporadic mutation (both hits are somatic) is characterized by unilateral retinoblastoma (Fig. 3.1).

11. Germline mutation results in familial retinoblastoma (2nd hit is somatic), characterized by bilateral retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.

IV. REGULATORS OF APOPTOSIS

A. Prevent apoptosis in normal cells, but promote apoptosis in mutated cells whose DNA cannot be repaired (e.g., Bcl2) l. Bcl2 normally stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, blocking release of cytochrome c.

2. Disruption of Bcl2 allows cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria and activate apoptosis.

B. Bcl2 is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma.

1.

t(l4;18) moves Bcl2 (chromosome 18) to the lg heavy chain locus (chromosome 14), resulting in increased Bcl2.

2.

Mitochondrial membrane is further stabilized, prohibiting apoptosis.

3.

B cells that would normally undergo apoptosis during somatic hypermutation in the lymph node germinal center accumulate, leading to lymphoma.

V. OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES OF TUMOR DEVELOPMENT

A. Telomerase is necessary for cell immortality.

1.

Normally, telomeres shorten with serial cell divisions, eventually resulting in cellular senescence.

2.

Cancers often have upregulated telomerase, which preserves telomeres.

B. Angiogenesis (production of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor survival and growth.

1. FGF and VEGF (angiogenic factors) are commonly produced by tumor cells.

C. Avoiding immune surveillance is necessary for tumor survival.

1.

Mutations often result in production of abnormal proteins, which are expressed on MHC class I.

2.

CDS+ T cells detect and destroy such mutated cells.

3.

Tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating expression of MHC class I.

4.

Immunodeficiency (both primary and secondary) increases risk for cancer.

I. TUMOR INVASION AND SPREAD

A. Accumulation of mutations eventually results in tumor invasion and spread.

1.

Epithelial tumor cells are normally attached to one another by cellular adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin).

2.

Downregulation of E-cadherin leads to dissociation of attached cells.

3.

Cells attach to laminin and destroy basement membrane (collagen type IV) via collagenase.

4.

Cells attach to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix and spread locally.

5.

Entrance into vascular or lymphatic spaces allows for metastasis (distant spread).

II. ROUTES OF METASTASIS

A. Lymphatic spread is characteristic of carcinomas.

1. Initial spread is to regional draining lymph nodes (Fig. 3.2).

B. Hematogenous spread is characteristic of sarcomas and some carcinomas.

1.

2.

3.

Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid 4.

C. Seeding of body cavities is characteristic of ovarian carcinoma, which often involves the peritoneum ('omental caking', Fig. 3.3).

I. CLINICAL FEATURES

A. Benign tumors tend to be slow growing, well circumscribed, distinct, and mobile.

B. Malignant tumors are usually rapid growing, poorly circumscribed, infiltrative, and fixed to surrounding tissues and local structures.

C. Biopsy or excision is generally required before a tumor can be classified as benign or malignant with certainty.

1. Some benign tumors can grow in a malignant-like fashion, and some malignant tumors can grow in a benign-like fashion.

A. Benign tumors are usually well differentiated (Fig. 3.4A). Characteristics include 1.

2.

3.

Low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 4.

5.

Lack of invasion (of basement membrane or local tissue) 6.

B. Malignant tumors are classically poorly differentiated (anaplastic, Fig. 3.4B). Characteristics include 1.

Disorganized growth (loss of polarity) 2.

3.

High nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 4.

High mitotic activity with atypical mitosis 5.

C. Metastatic potential is the hallmark of malignancy-benign tumors never metastasize.

IBll, ______________ F_U_N_D_A_M_E_N_T_A_L_S_O_F_P_A_T_H_O_L_O_G_Y_______

D. Immunohistochemistry is used to characterize tumors that are difficult to classify on histology (Fig. 3.5, Table 3.4).

III. SERUM TUMOR MARKERS

A. Proteins released by tumor into serum (e.g., PSA)

B. Useful for screening, monitoring response to treatment, and monitoring recurrence

C. Elevated levels require tissue biopsy for diagnosis of carcinoma (e.g., biopsy of prostate with elevated PSA).

IV.

A. Microscopic assessment of differentiation (i.e., how much a cancer resembles the tissue in which it grows); takes into account architectural and nuclear features 1.

2.

B. Important for determining prognosis; well-differentiated cancers have better prognosis than poorly-differentiated cancers.

V.

A. Assessment of size and spread of a cancer

B. Key prognostic factor; more important than grade

C. Determined after final surgical resection ofthe tumor

D. Utilizes TNM staging system 1.

T-tumor (size and/or depth of invasion) 2.

N-spread to regional lymph nodes; second most important prognostic factor 3.

I. HEMOSTASIS

A. Integrity of the blood vessel is necessary to carry blood to tissues.

1. Damage to the wall is repaired by hemostasis, which involves formation of a thrombus (clot) at the site of vessel injury.

B. Hemostasis occurs in two stages: primary and secondary.

1.

Primary hemostasis forms a weak platelet plug and is mediated by interaction between platelets and the vessel wall.

2.

Secondary hemostasis stabilizes the platelet plug and is mediated by the coagulation cascade.

I. PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Step 1-Transient vasoconstriction of damaged vessel 1. Mediated by reflex neural stimulation and endothelin release from endothelial cells

B. Step 2-Platelet adhesion to the surface of disrupted vessel 1.

Von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds exposed subendothelial collagen.

2.

Platelets bind vWF using the GPib receptor.

3.

vWF is derived from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and a-granules of platelets.

C. Step 3-Platelet degranulation 1. Adhesion induces shape change in platelets and degranulation with release of multiple mediators.

i. ADP is released from platelet dense granules; promotes exposure of GPilb/ Illa receptor on platelets.

11. TXA2 is synthesized by platelet cyclooxygenase (COX) and released; promotes platelet aggregation

D. Step 4-Platelet aggregation 1.

Platelets aggregate at the site of injury via GPIIb/llla using fibrinogen (from plasma) as a linking molecule; results in formation of platelet plug 2.

Platelet plug is weak; coagulation cascade (secondary hemostasis) stabilizes it.

II. DISORDERS OF PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Usually due to abnormalities in platelets; divided into quantitative or qualitative disorders

B. Clinical features include mucosa! and skin bleeding.

1.

Symptoms of mucosa! bleeding include epistaxis (most common overall symptom), hemoptysis, GI bleeding, hematuria, and menorrhagia. Intracranial bleeding occurs with severe thrombocytopenia.

2.

Symptoms of skin bleeding include petechiae (1-2 mm, Fig. 4.1), purpura (> 3 mm), ecchymoses (> 1 cm), and easy bruising; petechiae are a sign of thrombocytopenia and are not usually seen with qualitative disorders.

pathoma.com

C. Useful laboratory studies include 1.

Platelet count-normal 150-400 K/µL; < 50 K/µL leads to symptoms.

2.

Bleeding time-normal 2-7 minutes; prolonged with quantitative and qualitative platelet disorders 3.

Blood smear-used to assess number and size of platelets 4.

Bone marrow biopsy-used to assess megakaryocytes, which produce platelets

III. IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (ITP)

A. Autoimmune production oflgG against platelet antigens (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa) 1. Most common cause of thrombocytopenia in children and adults

B. Autoantibodies are produced by plasma cells in the spleen.

C. Antibody-bound platelets are consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in thrombocytopenia.

D. Divided into acute and chronic forms 1.

Acute form arises in children weeks after a viral infection or immunization; selflimited, usually resolving within weeks of presentation 2.

Chronic form arises in adults, usually women of childbearing age. May be primary or secondary (e.g., SLE). May cause short-lived thrombocytopenia in offspring since antiplatelet IgG can cross the placenta.

E. Laboratory findings include 1.

..J.. platelet count, often < 50 K/µL 2.

Normal PT/PTT-Coagulation factors are not affected.

3.

F. Initial treatment is corticosteroids. Children respond well; adults may show early response, but often relapse.

1.

IVIG is used to raise the platelet count in symptomatic bleeding, but its effect is short-lived.

2.

Splenectomy eliminates the primary source of antibody and the site of platelet destruction (performed in refractory cases).

IV. MICROANGIOPATHIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

A. Pathologic formation of platelet microthrombi in small vessels 1.

Platelets are consumed in the formation of microthrombi.

2.

RBCs are "sheared" as they cross microthrombi, resulting in hemolytic anemia with schistocytes (Fig. 4.2).

B. Seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)

C. TTP is due to decreased ADAMTS13, an enzyme that normally cleaves vWF multimers into smaller monomers for eventual degradation.

Fig. 4.1 Petechiae involving skin. Fig. 4.2 Schistocyte.

1.

Large, uncleaved multimers lead to abnormal platelet adhesion, resulting in microthrombi.

2.

Decreased ADAMTS13 is usually due to an acquired autoantibody; most commonly seen in adult females

D. HUS is due to endothelial damage by drugs or infection.

1.

Classically seen in children with E coli 0157:H? dysentery, which results from exposure to undercooked beef 2.

E coli verotoxin damages endothelial cells resulting in platelet microthrombi.

E. Clinical findings (HUS and TTP) include 1.

2.

3.

4.

Renal insufficiency (more common in HUS)-Thrombi involve vessels of the kidney.

5.

CNS abnormalities (more common in TTP)-Thrombi involve vessels of the CNS.

F. Laboratory findings include 1.

Thrombocytopenia with t bleeding time 2.

Normal PT/PTT (coagulation cascade is not activated) 3.

Anemia with schistocytes 4.

G. Treatment involves plasmapheresis and corticosteroids, particularly in TTP.

V. QUALITATIVE PLATELET DISORDERS

A. Bernard-Soulier syndrome is due to a genetic GPib deficiency; platelet adhesion is impaired.

1. Blood smear shows mild thrombocytopenia with enlarged platelets.

B. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is due to a genetic GPIIb/IIIa deficiency; platelet aggregation is impaired.

C. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase; lack of TXA impairs aggregation.

D. Uremia disrupts platelet function; both adhesion and aggregation are impaired.

I. SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Stabilizes the weak platelet plug via the coagulation cascade 1.

Coagulation cascade generates thrombin, which converts fibrinogen in the platelet plug to fibrin.

2.

Fibrin is then cross-linked, yielding a stable platelet-fibrin thrombus.

B. Factors of the coagulation cascade are produced by the liver in an inactive state. Activation requires 1. Exposure to an activating substance i. Tissue thromboplastin activates factor VII (extrinsic pathway).

ii. Subendothelial collagen activates factor XII (intrinsic pathway).

2.

Phospholipid surface of platelets 3.

II. DISORDERS OF SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Usually due to factor abnormalities

B. Clinical features include deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints (hemarthrosis) and rebleeding after surgical procedures (e.g., circumcision and wisdom tooth extraction).

C. Laboratory studies include 1.

Prothrombin time (PT)-measures extrinsic (factor VII) and common (factors II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade 2.

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)-measures intrinsic (factors XII, XI, IX,

VIII) and common (factors II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade

III. HEMOPHILIA A

A. Genetic factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency 1.

2.

B. Presents with deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding 1. Clinical severity depends on the degree of deficiency.

C. Laboratory findings include 1.

2.

,I, FVIII 3.

D. Treatment involves recombinant FVIII.

IV.

A. Genetic factor IX deficiency 1. Resembles hemophilia A, except FIX levels are decreased instead of FVIII

V.

A. Acquired antibody against a coagulation factor resulting in impaired factor function; anti-FVIII is most common.

1.

Clinical and lab findings are similar to hemophilia A.

2.

PTT does not correct upon mixing normal plasma with patient's plasma (mixing study) due to inhibitor; PTT does correct in hemophilia A.

VI. VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE

A. Genetic vWF deficiency 1. Most common inherited coagulation disorder

B. Multiple subtypes exist, causing quantitative and qualitative defects; the most common type is autosomal dominant with decreased vWF levels.

C. Presents with mild mucosa! and skin bleeding; low vWF impairs platelet adhesion.

D. Laboratory findings include 1.

2.

t PTT; normal PT-Decreased FVIII half-life (vWF normally stabilizes FVIII); however, deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding are usually not seen.

3.

Abnormal ristocetin test-Ristocetin induces platelet agglutination by causing vWF to bind platelet GPib; lack of vWF ➔ impaired agglutination ➔ abnormal test.

E. Treatment is desmopressin (ADH analog), which increases vWF release from Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells.

VII. VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY

A. Disrupts function of multiple coagulation factors 1.

Vitamin K is activated by epoxide reductase in the liver.

2.

Activated vitamin K gamma carboxylates factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S; gamma carboxylation is necessary for factor function.

B. Deficiency occurs in 1.

Newborns-due to lack of GI colonization by bacteria that normally synthesize vitamin K; vitamin K injection is given prophylactically to all newborns at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

2.

Long-term antibiotic therapy-disrupts vitamin K-producing bacteria in the GI tract 3.

Malabsorption-leads to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K

VIII. OTHER CAUSES OF ABNORMAL SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS

A. Liver failure-decreased production of coagulation factors and decreased activation ofvitamin K by epoxide reductase; effect of liver failure on coagulation is followed using PT.

B. Large-volume transfusion-dilutes coagulation factors, resulting in a relative deficiency

I. HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA

A. Platelet destruction that arises secondary to heparin therapy

B. Fragments of destroyed platelets may activate remaining platelets, leading to thrombosis.

II. DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

A. Pathologic activation of the coagulation cascade 1.

Widespread microthrombi result in ischemia and infarction.

2.

Consumption of platelets and factors results in bleeding, especially from IV sites and mucosa! surfaces (bleeding from body orifices).

B. Almost always secondary to another disease process 1.

Obstetric complications-Tissue thromboplastin in the amniotic fluid activates coagulation.

2.

Sepsis (especially with E Coli or N meningitidis)-Endotoxins from the bacterial wall and cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-1) induce endothelial cells to make tissue factor.

3.

Adenocarcinoma-Mucin activates coagulation.

4.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia-Primary granules activate coagulation.

5.

Rattlesnake bite-Venom activates coagulation.

C. Laboratory findings include 1.

j,. platelet count 2.

3.

j,. fibrinogen 4.

5.

Elevated fibrin split products, particularly D-dimer i. Elevated D-dimer is the best screening test for DIC.

ii. Derived from splitting of cross-linked fibrin; D-dimer is not produced from splitting of fibrinogen.

D. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause and transfusing blood products and cryoprecipitate (contains coagulation factors), as necessary.

III. DISORDERS OF FIBRINOLYSIS

A. Normal fibrinolysis removes thrombus after damaged vessel heals.

1.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) converts plasminogen to plasmin.

2.

Plasmin cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, destroys coagulation factors, and blocks platelet aggregation.

3.

a2-antiplasmin inactivates plasmin.

B. Disorders of fibrinolysis are due to plasmin overactivity resulting in excessive cleavage of serum fibrinogen. Examples include 1.

Radical prostatectomy-Release of urokinase activates plasmin.

2.

Cirrhosis ofliver-reduced production of a2-antiplasmin

C. Presents with increased bleeding (resembles DIC)

D. Laboratory findings include 1.

t PT/PTT-Plasmin destroys coagulation factors.

2.

t bleeding time with normal platelet count-Plasmin blocks platelet aggregation.

3.

Increased fibrinogen split products without D-dimers-Serum fibrinogen is lysed; however, D-dimers are not formed because fibrin thrombi are absent.

E. Treatment is aminocaproic acid, which blocks activation of plasminogen.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Pathologic formation of an intravascular blood clot (thrombus) 1.

2.

Most common location is the deep veins (DVT) of the leg below the knee.

B. Characterized by (1) lines of Zahn (alternating layers of platelets/fibrin and RBCs, Fig. 4.3) and (2) attachment to vessel wall 1. Both features distinguish thrombus from postmortem clot.

C. Three major risk factors for thrombosis are disruption in blood flow, endothelial cell damage, and hypercoagulable state (Virchow triad).

II. DISRUPTION IN NORMAL BLOOD FLOW

A. Stasis and turbulence of blood flow increases risk for thrombosis.

1. Blood flow is normally continuous and laminar; keeps platelets and factors dispersed and inactivated

B. Examples include 1.

2.

Cardiac wall dysfunction (e.g., arrhythmia or myocardial infarction) 3.

III. ENDOTHELIAL CELL DAMAGE

A. Endothelial damage disrupts the protective function of endothelial cells, increasing the risk for thrombosis.

B. Endothelial cells prevent thrombosis by several mechanisms.

1.

Block exposure to subendothelial collagen and underlying tissue factor 2.

Produce prostacyclin (PGI ) and NO-vasodilation and inhibition of platelet

Fig, 4.3 Lines of Zahn characterized by alternating layers of platelets/fibrin and RBCs.

3.

Secrete heparin-like molecules-augment antithrombin III (ATIII), which inactivates thrombin and coagulation factors 4.

Secrete tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-converts plasminogen to plasmin, which (1) cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, (2) destroys coagulation factors, and (3) blocks platelet aggregation 5.

Secrete thrombomodulin-redirects thrombin to activate protein C, which inactivates factors V and VIII

C. Causes of endothelial cell damage include atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and high levels of homocysteine.

1. Vitamin Bl2 and folate deficiency result in mildly elevated homocysteine levels, increasing the risk for thrombosis.

i. Folic acid (tetrahydrofolate, THF) circulates as methyl-THF in the serum.

11. Methyl is transferred to cobalamin (vitamin Bl2), allowing THF to participate in the synthesis of DNA precursors.

iii. Cobalamin transfers methyl to homocysteine resulting in methionine.

iv. Lack ofvitamin Bl2 or folate leads to decreased conversion of homocysteine to methionine resulting in buildup of homocysteine.

2. Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency results in high homocysteine levels with homocystinuria.

1. CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine; enzyme deficiency leads to homocysteine buildup.

ii. Characterized by vessel thrombosis, mental retardation, lens dislocation, and long slender fingers.

A. Due to excessive procoagulant proteins or defective anticoagulant proteins; may be inherited or acquired

B. Classic presentation is recurrent DVTs or DVT at a young age.

1. Usually occurs in the deep veins of the leg; other sites include hepatic and cerebral veins.

C. Protein C or S deficiency (autosomal dominant) decreases negative feedback on the coagulation cascade.

1.

Proteins C and S normally inactivate factors V and VIII.

2.

i. Initial stage of warfarin therapy results in a temporary deficiency of proteins C and S (due to shorter half-life) relative to factors II, VII, IX, and X ii. In preexisting C or S deficiency, a severe deficiency is seen at the onset of warfarin therapy increasing risk for thrombosis, especially in the skin.

D. Factor V Leiden is a mutated form of factor V that lacks the cleavage site for deactivation by proteins C and S.

1. Most common inherited cause of hypercoagulable state

E. Prothrombin 20210A is an inherited point mutation in prothrombin that results in increased gene expression.

1. Increased prothrombin results in increased thrombin, promoting thrombus formation.

F. A TIII deficiency decreases the protective effect of heparin-like molecules produced by the endothelium, increasing the risk for thrombus.

1.

Heparin-like molecules normally activate ATIII, which inactivates thrombin and coagulation factors.

2.

In ATIII deficiency, PTT does not rise with standard heparin dosing.

1. Pharmacologic heparin works by binding and activating ATIII.

11. High doses of heparin activate limited ATIII; coumadin is then given to maintain an anticoagulated state.

I.

II.

G. Oral contraceptives are associated with a hypercoagulable state.

1. Estrogen induces increased production of coagulation factors, thereby increasing the risk for thrombosis.

A. Intravascular mass that travels and occludes downstream vessels; symptoms depend on the vessel involved.

B. Thromboembolus is due to a thrombus that dislodges; most common type of embolus (>95%)

C. Atherosclerotic embolus is due to an atherosclerotic plaque that dislodges.

1. Characterized by the presence of cholesterol clefts in the embolus (Fig. 4.4A)

D. Fat embolus is associated with bone fractures, particularly long bones, and soft tissue trauma.

1.

Develops while fracture is still present or shortly after repair 2.

Characterized by dyspnea (fat, often with bone marrow elements, is seen in pulmonary vessels, Fig. 4.4B) and petechiae on the skin overlying the chest

E. Gas embolus is classically seen in decompression sickness.

1.

Nitrogen gas precipitates out of blood due to rapid ascent by a diver.

2.

Presents with joint and muscle pain ('bends') and respiratory symptoms ('chokes').

3.

Chronic form (Caisson disease) is characterized by multifocal ischemic necrosis of bone.

4.

Gas embolus may also occur during laparoscopic surgery (air is pumped into the abdomen).

F. Amniotic fluid embolus enters maternal circulation during labor or delivery 1.

Presents with shortness of breath, neurologic symptoms, and DIC (due to the thrombogenic nature of amniotic fluid) 2.

Characterized by squamous cells and keratin debris, from fetal skin, in embolus (Fig. 4.4C)

A. Usually due to thromboembolus; the most common source is deep venous thrombus (DVT) of the lower extremity, usually involving the femoral, iliac, or popliteal veins.

B. Most often clinically silent because (1) the lung has a dual blood supply (via pulmonary and bronchial arteries) and (2) the embolus is usually small (selfresolves)

Fig. 4.4 Emboli. A, Atherosclerotic em bolus characterized by cholesterol clefts. B, Fat embolus with bone marrow elements. C, Amniotic fluid em bolus with squamous cells and keratin debris from fetal skin. (A, Courtesy of Professor A. Garfia. C, Courtesy of Shakuntala Teas, MD)

C. Pulmonary infarction occurs if a large-or medium-sized artery is obstructed in patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary compromise; only 10% of PEs cause infarction.

1.

Presents with shortness of breath, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural effusion 2.

V/Q lung scan shows mismatch; perfusion is abnormal.

3.

Spiral CT shows a vascular filling defect in the lung.

4.

Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound is useful to detect DVT.

5.

D-dimer is elevated.

6.

Gross examination reveals a hemorrhagic, wedge-shaped infarct.

D. Sudden death occurs with a large saddle embolus that blocks both left and right pulmonary arteries or with significant occlusion of a large pulmonary artery (Fig. 4.5); death is due to electromechanical dissociation.

E. Pulmonary hypertension may arise with chronic emboli that are reorganized over time.

III. SYSTEMIC EMBOLISM

A. Usually due to thromboembolus

B. Most commonly arise in the left heart

C. Travel down systemic circulation to occlude flow to organs, most commonly the lower extremities

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Reduction in circulating red blood cell (RBC) mass

B. Presents with signs and symptoms of hypoxia 1.

Weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea 2.

3.

4.

Angina, especially with preexisting coronary artery disease

C. Hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and RBC count are used as surrogates for RBC mass, which is difficult to measure.

1. Anemia is defined as Hb < 13.5 g/dL in males and < 12.5 g/dL in females (normal Hb is 13.5-17.5 g/dL in males and 12.5-16.0 g/dL in females).

D. Based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV), anemia can be classified as microcytic (MCV < 80 µm3), normocytic (MCV = 80-100 µm 3), or macrocytic (MCV > 100 µm 3).

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with MCV < 80 µm 3

B. Microcytic anemias are due to decreased production of hemoglobin.

1.

RBC progenitor cells in the bone marrow are large and normally divide multiple times to produce smaller mature cells (MCV = 80-100 µm 3).

2.

Microcytosis is due to an "extra" division which occurs to maintain hemoglobin concentration.

C. Hemoglobin is made of heme and globin; heme is composed of iron and protoporphyrin. A decrease in any of these components leads to microcytic anemia.

D. Microcytic anemias include (1) iron deficiency anemia, (2) anemia of chronic disease, (3) sideroblastic anemia, and (4) thalassemia.

II. IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

A. Due to decreased levels of iron 1. ..I.-iron ➔ ..I.-heme ➔ ..I.-hemoglobin ➔ microcytic anemia

B. Most common type of anemia 1. Lack of iron is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, affecting roughly 1/3 of world's population.

C. Iron is consumed in heme (meat-derived) and non-heme (vegetable-derived) forms.

1.

Absorption occurs in the duodenum. Enterocytes have heme and non-heme (DMTl) transporters; the heme form is more readily absorbed.

2.

Enterocytes transport iron across the cell membrane into blood via ferroportin.

3.

Transferrin transports iron in the blood and delivers it to liver and bone marrow macrophages for storage.

4.

Stored intracellular iron is bound to ferritin, which prevents iron from forming free radicals via the Fenton reaction.

D. Laboratory measurements of iron status 1.

Serum iron-measure of iron in the blood 2.

Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)-measure of transferrin molecules in the blood 3.

% saturation-percentage of transferrin molecules that are bound by iron (normal is 33%) 4.

Serum ferritin-reflects iron stores in macrophages and the liver

E. Iron deficiency is usually caused by dietary lack or blood loss.

1.

Infants-breast-feeding (human milk is low in iron) 2.

3.

4.

Elderly-colon polyps/carcinoma in the Western world; hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) in the developing world 5.

Other causes include malnutrition, malabsorption, and gastrectomy (acid aids iron absorption by maintaining the Fe2+ state, which is more readily absorbed than Fe3+).

F. Stages of iron deficiency 1.

Storage iron is depleted--J.. ferritin; t TIBC 2.

Serum iron is depleted--J.. serum iron; -J.. % saturation 3.

Normocytic anemia-Bone marrow makes fewer, but normal-sized, RBCs.

4.

G. Clinical features of iron deficiency include anemia, koilonychia, and pica.

H. Laboratory findings include 1.

Microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with t red cell distribution width (RDW, Fig. 5.1) 2.

-J.. ferritin; t TIBC; -J.. serum iron; -J.. % saturation 3.

I. Treatment involves supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate).

J. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is iron deficiency anemia with esophageal web and atrophic glossitis; presents as anemia, dysphagia, and beefy-red tongue

III. ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE

A. Anemia associated with chronic inflammation (e.g., endocarditis or autoimmune conditions) or cancer; most common type of anemia in hospitalized patients

B. Chronic disease results in production of acute phase reactants from the liver, including hepcidin.

1. Hepcidin sequesters iron in storage sites by (1) limiting iron transfer from macrophages to erythroid precursors and (2) suppressing erythropoietin (EPO)

Fig. 5.1 Microcytic, hypochromic RBCs of iron Fig. 5.2 Ringed sideroblasts (Prussian blue stain). deficiency anemia.

production; aim is to prevent bacteria from accessing iron, which is necessary for their survival.

2. ..l.-available iron ➔ ..l.-heme ➔ ..l.-hemoglobin ➔ microcytic anemia

C. Laboratory findings include 1.

t ferritin, ..l.-TIBC, ..l.-serum iron, and ..l.-% saturation 2.

D. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause.

IV.

A. Anemia due to defective protoporphyrin synthesis 1. ..l.-protoporphyrin ➔ ..l.-heme ➔ ..l.-hemoglobin ➔ microcytic anemia

B. Protoporphyrin is synthesized via a series of reactions.

1.

Aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALAS) converts succinyl CoA to aminolevulinic acid (ALA) using vitamin B6 as a cofactor (rate-limiting step).

2.

Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) converts ALA to porphobilinogen.

3.

Additional reactions convert porphobilinogen to protoporphyrin.

4.

Ferrochelatase attaches protoporphyrin to iron to make heme (final reaction; occurs in the mitochondria).

C. Iron is transferred to erythroid precursors and enters the mitochondria to form heme. If protoporphyrin is deficient, iron remains trapped in mitochondria.

1. Iron-laden mitochondria form a ring around the nucleus of erythroid precursors; these cells are called ringed sideroblasts (hence, the term sideroblastic anemia, Fig. 5.2).

D. Sideroblastic anemia can be congenital or acquired.

1.

Congenital defect most commonly involves ALAS (rate-limiting enzyme).

2.

1. Alcoholism-mitochondrial poison ii. Lead poisoning-inhibits ALAD and ferrochelatase iii. Vitamin B6 deficiency-required cofactor for ALAS; most commonly seen as a side effect of isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis

E. Laboratory findings include t ferritin, -1, TIBC, t serum iron, and t % saturation (iron-overloaded state).

V.

A. Anemia due to decreased synthesis of the globin chains of hemoglobin 1. -1, globin ➔ -1, hemoglobin ➔ microcytic anemia

B. Inherited mutation; carriers are protected against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

C. Divided into a-and P-thalassemia based on decreased production of alpha or beta globin chains.

1. Normal types of hemoglobin are HbF (a2y), HbA (a2p), and HbA2 (a/\).

Table 5.1: Laboratory Findings in Microcytic Anemia

Anemia of Chronic Disease High Low Low Low

D.

E.

a-Thalassemia is usually due to gene deletion; normally, 4 alpha genes are present on chromosome 16.

1.

2.

Two genes deleted-mild anemia with t RBC count; cis deletion is associated with an increased risk of severe thalassemia in offspring.

i. Cis deletion is when both deletions occur on the same chromosome; seen in Asians ii. Trans deletion is when one deletion occurs on each chromosome; seen in Africans, including African Americans 3.

Three genes deleted-severe anemia; p chains form tetramers (HbH) that damage RBCs; HbH is seen on electrophoresis.

4.

(Hb Barts) that damage RBCs; Hb Barts is seen on electrophoresis. P-Thalassemia is usually due to gene mutations (point mutations in promoter or splicing sites); seen in individuals of African and Mediterranean descent 1.

Two p genes are present on chromosome 11; mutations result in absent (P0) or diminished (p+) production of the p-globin chain.

2.

P-Thalassemia minor (PIP+) is the mildest form of disease and is usually asymptomatic with an increased RBC count.

i. Microcytic, hypochromic RBCs and target cells are seen on blood smear (Fig. 5.3).

ii. Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows slightly decreased HbA with increased HbA (5%, normal 2.5%) and HbF (2%, normal 1%).

3. P-Thalassemia major (P 0!pa) is the most severe form of disease and presents with severe anemia a few months after birth; high HbF (a2y) at birth is temporarily protective.

i. Unpaired a chains precipitate and damage RBC membrane, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and extravascular hemolysis (removal of circulating RBCs by the spleen).

ii. Massive erythroid hyperplasia ensues resulting in (1) expansion of hematopoiesis into the skull (reactive bone formation leads to 'crewcut' appearance on x-ray, Fig. 5.4) and facial bones ('chipmunk facies'), (2) extramedullary hematopoiesis with hepatosplenomegaly, and (3) risk of aplastic crisis with parvovirus Bl9 infection of erythroid precursors.

iii. Chronic transfusions are often necessary; leads to risk for secondary hemochromatosis iv.

Smear shows microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with target cells and nucleated red blood cells.

v.

Electrophoresis shows HbA and HbF with little or no HbA.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with MCV > 100 µm3; most commonly due to folate or vitamin Bl2 deficiency (megaloblastic anemia)

B. Folate and vitamin Bl2 are necessary for synthesis of DNA precursors.

1.

Folate circulates in the serum as methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl THF); removal of the methyl group allows for participation in the synthesis of DNA precursors.

2.

Methyl group is transferred to vitamin Bl2 (cobalamin).

3.

Vitamin Bl2 then transfers it to homocysteine, producing methionine.

C. Lack of folate or vitamin Bl2 impairs synthesis of DNA precursors.

1.

Impaired division and enlargement of RBC precursors leads to megaloblastic anemia.

2.

Impaired division of granulocytic precursors leads to hypersegmented neutrophils.

3.

Megaloblastic change is also seen in rapidly-dividing (e.g., intestinal) epithelial cells.

D. Other causes of macrocytic anemia (without megaloblastic change) include alcoholism, liver disease, and drugs (e.g., 5-FU).

II. FOLATE DEFICIENCY

A. Dietary folate is obtained from green vegetables and some fruits.

1. Absorbed in the jejunum

B. Folate deficiency develops within months, as body stores are minimal.

C. Causes include poor diet (e.g., alcoholics and elderly), increased demand (e.g., pregnancy, cancer, and hemolytic anemia), and folate antagonists (e.g., methotrexate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase).

D. Clinical and laboratory findings include 1.

Macrocytic RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils (> 5 lobes, Fig. 5.5) 2.

3.

.,J., serum folate 4.

5.

Ill. VITAMIN Bl2 DEFICIENCY

A. Dietary vitamin Bl2 is complexed to animal-derived proteins.

1.

Salivary gland enzymes (e.g., amylase) liberate vitamin Bl 2, which is then bound by R-binder (also from the salivary gland) and carried through the stomach.

2.

Pancreatic proteases in the duodenum detach vitamin Bl2 from R-binder.

3.

Vitamin Bl2 binds intrinsic factor (made by gastric parietal cells) in the small bowel; the intrinsic factor-vitamin Bl2 complex is absorbed in the ileum.

B. Vitamin Bl2 deficiency is less common than folate deficiency and takes years to develop due to large hepatic stores of vitamin Bl 2.

C. Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of vitamin Bl2 deficiency.

1. Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells (body of stomach) leads to intrinsic factor deficiency

D. Other causes of vitamin Bl2 deficiency include pancreatic insufficiency and damage to the terminal ileum (e.g., Crohn disease or Diphyllobothrium latum [fish tapeworm]); dietary deficiency is rare, except in vegans.

E. Clinical and laboratory findings include 1.

Macrocytic RBCs with hypersegmented neutrophils 2.

3.

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord i. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonic acid to succinyl CoA (important in fatty acid metabolism).

ii. Vitamin B12 deficiency results in increased levels of methylmalonic acid, which impairs spinal cord myelinization.

iii. Damage results in poor proprioception and vibratory sensation (posterior column) and spastic paresis (lateral corticospinal tract).

4.

-.J, serum vitamin B12 5.

t serum homocysteine (similar to folate deficiency), which increases risk for thrombosis 6.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anemia with normal-sized RBCs (MCV = 80-100 µm3)

B. Due to increased peripheral destruction or underproduction 1. Reticulocyte count helps to distinguish between these two etiologies.

II. RETICULOCYTES

A. Young RBCs released from the bone marrow 1. Identified on blood smear as larger cells with bluish cytoplasm (due to residual RNA, Fig. 5.6)

B. Normal reticulocyte count (RC) is 1-2%.

1. RBC lifespan is 120 days; each day roughly 1-2% ofRBCs are removed from circulation and replaced by reticulocytes.

C. A properly functioning marrow responds to anemia by increasing the RC to > 3%.

D. RC, however, is falsely elevated in anemia.

1. RC is measured as percentage of total RBCs; decrease in total RBCs falsely elevates percentage of reticulocytes.

E. RC is corrected by multiplying reticulocyte count by Hct/45.

1.

Corrected count > 3% indicates good marrow response and suggests peripheral destruction.

2.

Corrected count < 3% indicates poor marrow response and suggests underproduction.

III. PERIPHERAL RBC DESTRUCTION (HEMOLYSIS)

A. Divided into extravascular and intravascular hemolysis; both result in anemia with a good marrow response.

B. Extravascular hemolysis involves RBC destruction by the reticuloendothelial system (macrophages of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes).

Fig. 5.6 Reticulocyte. Fig. 5.7 Spherocytes.

1. Macrophages consume RBCs and break down hemoglobin.

i. Globin is broken down into amino acids.

ii. Heme is broken down into iron and protoporphyrin; iron is recycled.

111. Protoporphyrin is broken down into unconjugated bilirubin, which is bound to serum albumin and delivered to the liver for conjugation and excretion into bile.

2. Clinical and laboratory findings include i. Anemia with splenomegaly, jaundice due to unconjugated bilirubin, and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones ii. Marrow hyperplasia with corrected reticulocyte count> 3%

C. Intravascular hemolysis involves destruction of RBCs within vessels.

1. Clinical and laboratory findings include 1. Hemoglobinemia 11. Hemoglobinuria iii. Hemosiderinuria-Renal tubular cells pick up some of the hemoglobin that is filtered into the urine and break it down into iron, which accumulates as hemosiderin; tubular cells are eventually shed resulting in hemosiderinuria.

iv. Decreased serum haptoglobin

I. HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

A. Inherited defect ofRBC cytoskeleton-membrane tethering proteins 1. Most commonly involves ankyrin, spectrin, or band 3

B. Membrane blebs are formed and lost over time.

1.

Loss of membrane renders cells round (spherocytes) instead of disc-shaped.

2.

Spherocytes are less able to maneuver through splenic sinusoids and are consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in anemia.

C. Clinical and laboratory findings include 1.

Spherocytes with loss of central pallor (Fig. 5.7) 2.

3.

Splenomegaly, jaundice with unconjugated bilirubin, and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones (extravascular hemolysis) 4.

Increased risk for a plastic crisis with parvovirus Bl9 infection of erythroid precursors

D. Diagnosed by osmotic fragility test, which reveals increased spherocyte fragility in hypotonic solution

E. Treatment is splenectomy; anemia resolves, but spherocytes persist and Howell-Jolly bodies (fragments of nuclear material in RBCs) emerge on blood smear (Fig. 5.8).

II. SICKLE CELL ANEMIA

A. Autosomal recessive mutation in~ chain of hemoglobin; a single amino acid change replaces normal glutamic acid (hydrophilic) with valine (hydrophobic).

B. Gene is carried by 10% of individuals of African descent, likely due to protective role against falciparum malaria.

C. Sickle cell disease arises when two abnormal ~ genes are present; results in >90% HbS in RBCs

D. HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated; polymers aggregate into needle-like structures, resulting in sickle cells (Fig. 5.9).

1.

Increased risk of sickling occurs with hypoxemia, dehydration, and acidosis.

2.

HbF protects against sickling; high HbF at birth is protective for the first few months of life. Treatment with hydroxyurea increases levels ofHbF.

E.

F.

G.

H.

Cells continuously sickle and de-sickle while passing through the microcirculation, resulting in complications related to RBC membrane damage.

1.

Extravascular hemolysis-Reticuloendothelial system removes RBCs with damaged membranes, leading to anemia, jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones.

2.

Intravascular hemolysis-RBCs with damaged membranes dehydrate, leading to hemolysis with decreased haptoglobin and target cells on blood smear.

3.

i. Expansion of hematopoiesis into the skull ('crewcut' appearance on x-ray) and facia l bones ('chipmunk facies') 11. Extramedullary hematopoiesis with hepatomegaly iii. Risk of aplastic crisis with parvovirus B19 infection of erythroid precursors Extensive sickling leads to complications of vaso-occlusion.

1.

Dactylitis-swollen hands and feet due to vaso-occlusive infarcts in bones; common presenting sign in infants 2.

Autosplenectomy-shrunken, fibrotic spleen. Consequences include i. Increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (most common cause of death in children); affected children should be vaccinated by 5 years of age.

ii. Increased risk of Salmonella paratyphi osteomyelitis iii. Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smear 3.

i. Presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and lung infiltrates ii. Often precipitated by pneumonia iii. Most common cause of death in adult patients 4.

5.

Renal papillary necrosis-results in gross hematuria and proteinuria Sickle cell trait is the presence of one mutated and one normal pchain; results in < 50% HbS in RBCs (HbA is slightly more efficiently produced than HbS) 1. Generally asymptomatic with no anemia; RBCs with < 50% HbS do not sickle in vivo except in the renal medulla.

1. Extreme hypoxia and hypertonicity of the medulla cause sickling, which results in microinfarctions leading to microscopic hematuria and, eventually, decreased ability to concentrate urine.

1.

Sickle cells and target cells are seen on blood smear in sickle cell disease, but not in sickle cell trait.

2.

Metabisulfite screen causes cells with any amount of HbS to sickle; positive in both disease and trait 3.

Hb electrophoresis confirms the presence and amount ofHbS.

Fig. 5.8 Fragment of nuclear remnant (HowellFig. 5.9 Sickle cell disease. Fig. 5.10 Hemoglobin C crystal. Jolly body) within RBC.

Red Blood Cell Disorders _,...

i. Disease-90% HbS, 8% HbF, 2% HbA (no HbA) ii. Trait-55% HbA, 43% HbS, 2% HbA2

III. HEMOGLOBIN C

A. Autosomal recessive mutation in ~ chain of hemoglobin 1.

Normal glutamic acid is replaced by lysine.

2.

B. Presents with mild anemia due to extravascular hemolysis

C. Characteristic HbC crystals are seen in RBCs on blood smear (Fig. 5.10).

I. PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH)

A. Acquired defect in myeloid stem cells resulting in absent glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI); renders cells susceptible to destruction by complement 1.

Blood cells coexist with complement.

2.

Decay accelerating factor (DAF) on the surface of blood cells protects against complement-mediated damage by inhibiting C3 convertase.

3.

DAF is secured to the cell membrane by GPI (an anchoring glycolipid).

4.

Absence of GPI leads to absence of DAF, rendering cells susceptible to complement-mediated damage.

B. Intravascular hemolysis occurs episodically, often at night during sleep.

1.

Mild respiratory acidosis develops with shallow breathing during sleep and activates complement.

2.

RBCs, WBCs, and platelets are lysed.

3.

Intravascular hemolysis leads to hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria (especially in the morning); hemosiderinuria is seen days after hemolysis.

C. Sucrose test is used to screen for disease; confirmatory test is the acidified serum test or flow cytometry to detect lack of CDSS (DAF) on blood cells.

D. Main cause of death is thrombosis of the hepatic, portal, or cerebral veins.

1. Destroyed platelets release cytoplasmic contents into circulation, inducing thrombosis.

E. Complications include iron deficiency anemia (due to chronic loss of hemoglobin in the urine) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which develops in 10% of patients.

II. GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (G6PD) DEFICIENCY

A. X-linked recessive disorder resulting in reduced half-life of G6PD; renders cells susceptible to oxidative stress 1.

RBCs are normally exposed to oxidative stress, in particular H20 2• 2.

Glutathione (an antioxidant) neutralizes H 0 , but becomes oxidized in the process.

3.

NADPH, a by-product of G6PD, is needed to regenerate reduced glutathione.

4.

,J, G6PD ➔ ,J, NADPH ➔ ,J, reduced glutathione ➔ oxidative injury by H20 2 ➔ intravascular hemolysis

B. G6PD deficiency has two major variants.

1.

African variant-mildly reduced half-life of G6PD leading to mild intravascular hemolysis with oxidative stress 2.

Mediterranean variant-markedly reduced half-life of G6PD leading to marked intravascular hemolysis with oxidative stress 3.

High carrier frequency in both populations is likely due to protective role against falciparum malaria.

C. Oxidative stress precipitates Hb as Heinz bodies.

1.

Causes of oxidative stress include infections, drugs (e.g., primaquine, sulfa drugs, and dapsone), and fava beans.

2.

Heinz bodies are removed from RBCs by splenic macrophages, resulting in bite cells (Fig. 5.11).

3.

Leads to predominantly intravascular hemolysis

D. Presents with hemoglobinuria and back pain hours after exposure to oxidative stress

E. Heinz preparation is used to screen for disease (precipitated hemoglobin can only be seen with a special Heinz stain, Fig. 5.12); enzyme studies confirm deficiency (performed weeks after hemolytic episode resolves).

III. IMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (IHA)

A. Antibody-mediated (IgG or IgM) destruction ofRBCs

B. IgG-mediated disease usually involves extravascular hemolysis.

1.

IgG binds RBCs in the relatively warm temperature of the central body (warm agglutinin); membrane of antibody-coated RBC is consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in spherocytes.

2.

Associated with SLE (most common cause), CLL, and certain drugs (classically, penicillin and cephalosporins) i. Drug may attach to RBC membrane (e.g., penicillin) with subsequent binding of antibody to drug-membrane complex ii. Drug may induce production of autoantibodies (e.g., a-methyldopa) that bind self antigens on RBCs 3.

Treatment involves cessation of the offending drug, steroids, IVIG, and, if necessary, splenectomy.

C. IgM-mediated disease can lead to intravascular hemolysis.

1.

IgM binds RBCs and fixes complement in the relatively cold temperature of the extremities (cold agglutinin).

2.

RBCs inactivate complement, but residual C3b serves as an opsonin for splenic macrophages resulting in spherocytes; extreme activation of complement can lead to intravascular hemolysis.

3.

Associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and infectious mononucleosis.

D. Coombs test is used to diagnose IHA; testing can be direct or indirect.

1.

Direct Coombs test confirms the presence of antibody-or complement-coated RBCs. When anti-IgG/complement is added to patient RBCs, agglutination occurs if RBCs are already coated with IgG or complement. This is the most important test for IHA.

2.

Indirect Coombs test confirms the presence of antibodies in patient serum. AntiIgG and test RBCs are mixed with the patient serum; agglutination occurs if serum antibodies are present.

Fig. 5.11 Bite cell. Fig. 5.12 Heinz bodies (Heinz preparation). Fig. 5.13 Schistocyte.

IV.

A. Intravascular hemolysis that results from vascular pathology; RBCs are destroyed as they pass through the circulation.

1. Iron deficiency anemia occurs with chronic hemolysis.

B. Occurs with microthrombi (TTP-HUS, DIC, HELLP), prosthetic heart valves, and aortic stenosis; when present, microthrombi produce schistocytes on blood smear (Fig. 5.13).

V.

A. Infection ofRBCs and liver with Plasmodium (Fig. 5.14); transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito

B. RBCs rupture as a part of the Plasm odium life cycle, resulting in intravascular hemolysis and cyclical fever.

1.

2.

C. Spleen also consumes some infected RBCs; results in mild extravascular hemolysis with splenomegaly

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Decreased production of RBCs by bone marrow; characterized by low corrected reticulocyte count

B. Etiologies include 1.

Causes of microcytic and macrocytic anemia 2.

Renal failure-decreased production of EPO by peritubular interstitial cells 3.

Damage to bone marrow precursor cells (may result in anemia or pancytopenia)

II. PARVOVIRUS Bl9

A. Infects progenitor red cells and temporarily halts erythropoiesis; leads to significant anemia in the setting of preexisting marrow stress (e.g., sickle cell anemia).

B. Treatment is supportive (infection is self-limited).

III. APLASTIC ANEMIA

A. Damage to hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia) with low reticulocyte count

B. Etiologies include drugs or chemicals, viral infections, and autoimmune damage.

C. Biopsy reveals an empty, fatty marrow (Fig. 5.15).

Fig. 5.14 Erythrocytes infected with P falciparum. Fig. 5.15 Aplastic anemia. (Courtesy of Paulo Mourao, MD)

D. Treatment includes cessation of any causative drugs and supportive care with transfusions and marrow-stimulating factors (e.g., erythropoietin, GM-CSF, and G-CSF).

1.

Immunosuppression may be helpful as some idiopathic cases are due to abnormal T-cell activation with release of cytokines.

2.

May require bone marrow transplantation as a last resort

IV. MYELOPHTHISIC PROCESS

A. Pathologic process (e.g., metastatic cancer) that replaces bone marrow; hematopoiesis is impaired, resulting in pancytopenia.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Hematopoiesis occurs via a stepwise maturation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (Fig. 6.1).

B. Cells mature and are released from the bone marrow into the blood.

C. A normal white blood cell (WBC) count is approximately 5-10 K/µL.

l. A low WBC count(< 5 K) is called leukopenia.

2.

A high WBC count(> 10 K) is called leukocytosis.

3.

A low or high WBC count is usually due to a decrease or increase in one particular cell lineage.

II. LEUKOPENIA

A. Neutropenia refers to a decreased number of circulating neutrophils. Causes include l. Drug toxicity (e.g., chemotherapy with alkylating agents)-Damage to stem cells results in decreased production of WBCs, especially neutrophils.

2.

Severe infection (e.g., gram-negative sepsis)-Increased movement of neutrophils into tissues results in decreased circulating neutrophils.

3.

As a treatment, GM-CSF or G-CSF may be used to boost granulocyte production, thereby decreasing risk of infection in neutropenic patients.

B. Lymphopenia refers to a decreased number of circulating lymphocytes. Causes include l. Immunodeficiency (e.g., Di George syndrome or HIV) 2.

High cortisol state (e.g., exogenous corticosteroids or Cushing syndrome)induces apoptosis of lymphocytes 3.

Autoimmune destruction (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) 4.

Whole body radiation-Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to radiation; lymphopenia is the earliest change to emerge after whole body radiation.

III. LEUKOCYTOSIS

A. Neutrophilic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating neutrophils. Causes include l. Bacterial infection or tissue necrosis-induces release of marginated pool and bone marrow neutrophils, including immature forms (left shift); immature cells are characterized by decreased Fe receptors (CD16).

Fig. 6.1 Hematopoiesis.

pathoma.com 2. High cortisol state-impairs leukocyte adhesion, leading to release of marginated pool of neutrophils

B. Monocytosis refers to increased circulating monocytes. Causes include chronic inflammatory states (e.g., autoimmune and infectious) and malignancy.

C. Eosinophilia refers to increased circulating eosinophils. Causes include allergic reactions (type I hypersensitivity), parasitic infections, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Eosinophilia is driven by increased eosinophil chemotactic factor.

D. Basophilia refers to increased circulating basophils; classically seen in chronic myeloid leukemia

E. Lymphocytic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating lymphocytes. Causes include 1.

Viral infections-T lymphocytes undergo hyperplasia in response to virally infected cells.

2.

Bordetella pertussis infection-Bacteria produce lymphocytosis-promoting factor, which blocks circulating lymphocytes from leaving the blood to enter the lymph node.

IV. INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS (IM)

A. EBV infection that results in a lymphocytic leukocytosis comprised of reactive CDs+ T cells; CMV is a less common cause.

1. EBV is transmitted by saliva ("kissing disease"); classically affects teenagers

B. EBV primarily infects 1.

Oropharynx, resulting in pharyngitis 2.

Liver, resulting in hepatitis with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes 3.

C. CDs+ T-cell response leads to 1.

Generalized lymphadenopathy (LAD) due to T-cell hyperplasia in the lymph node paracortex 2.

Splenomegaly due to T-cell hyperplasia in the periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) 3.

High WBC count with atypical lymphocytes (reactive CDs+ T cells) in the blood (Fig. 6.2)

D. The monospot test is used for screening.

1.

Detects IgM antibodies that cross-react with horse or sheep red blood cells (heterophile antibodies) 2.

3.

A negative monospot test suggests CMV as a possible cause of IM.

4.

Definitive diagnosis is made by serologic testing for the EBV viral capsid antigen.

Fig. 6.2 Atypical lymphocyte, infectious Fig. 6.3 Splenic rupture. (Courtesy of K.V. mononucleosis. Santosh, MD)

E. Complications 1.

Increased risk for splenic rupture (Fig. 6.3); patients are generally advised to avoid contact sports for one month.

2.

Rash if exposed to ampicillin 3.

Dormancy of virus in B cells leads to increased risk for both recurrence and B-cell lymphoma, especially if immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV) develops.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neoplastic proliferation of blasts; defined as the accumulation of > 20% blasts in the bone marrow.

B. Increased blasts "crowd-out" normal hematopoiesis, resulting in an "acute" presentation with anemia (fatigue), thrombocytopenia (bleeding), or neutropenia (infection).

C. Blasts usually enter the blood stream, resulting in a high WBC count.

1. Blasts are large, immature cells, often with punched out nucleoli (Fig. 6.4).

D. Acute leukemia is subdivided into acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) based on the phenotype of the blasts.

II. ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

A. Neoplastic accumulation oflymphoblasts (> 20%) in the bone marrow 1.

Lymphoblasts are characterized by positive nuclear staining for TdT, a DNA polymerase.

2.

TdT is absent in myeloid blasts and mature lymphocytes.

B. Most commonly arises in children; associated with Down syndrome (usually arises after the age of 5 years)

C. Subclassified into B-ALL and T-ALL based on surface markers

D. B-ALL is the most common type of ALL.

1.

Usually characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT+) that express CDlO, CD19, and CD20.

2.

Excellent response to chemotherapy; requires prophylaxis to scrotum and CSF (Fig. 6.5) 3.

Prognosis is based on cytogenetic abnormalities.

i. t(l2;21) has a good prognosis; more commonly seen in children ii. t(9;22) has a poor prognosis; more commonly seen in adults (Philadelphia+ ALL)

E. T-ALL is characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT+) that express markers ranging from CD2 to CDS (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD7). The blasts do not express CDlO.

Fig. 6.4 Blasts of acute leukemia. Fig. 6.5 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia involving meninges.

1. Usually presents in teenagers as a mediastinal (thymic) mass (called acute lymphoblastic lymphoma because the malignant cells form a mass)

III. ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA

A. Neoplastic accumulation of immature myeloid cells (> 20%) in the bone marrow

B. Myeloblasts are usually characterized by positive cytoplasmic staining for myeloperoxidase (MPO).

1. Crystal aggregates of MPO may be seen as Auer rods (Fig. 6.6).

C. Most commonly arises in older adults (average age is 50-60 years)

D. Subclassification based on cytogenetic abnormalities, lineage of immature myeloid cells, and surface markers. High-yield subtypes include 1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) i. Characterized by t(l5;17), which involves translocation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) on chromosome 17 to chromosome 15; RAR disruption blocks maturation and promyelocytes (blasts) accumulate.

ii. Abnormal promyelocytes contain numerous primary granules that increase the risk for DIC.

iii. Treatment is with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, a vitamin A derivative), which binds the altered receptor and causes the blasts to mature (and eventually die).

2. Acute monocytic leukemia i. Proliferation of monoblasts; usually lack MPO ii. Blasts characteristically infiltrate gums (Fig. 6.7).

3. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia i. Proliferation of megakaryoblasts; lack MPO ii. Associated with Down syndrome (usually arises before the age of 5)

E. AML may also arise from pre-existing dysplasia (myelodysplastic syndromes), especially with prior exposure to alkylating agents or radiotherapy.

1.

Myelodysplastic syndromes usually present with cytopenias, hypercellular bone marrow, abnormal maturation ofcells, and increased blasts(< 20%).

2.

Most patients die from infection or bleeding, though some progress to acute leukemia.

B. Usually insidious in onset and seen in older adults

II. CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL)

A. Neoplastic proliferation of naive B cells that co-express CDS and CD20; most common leukemia overall

D. Complications include 1.

Hypogammaglobulinemia-Infection is the most common cause of death in CLL.

2.

3.

Transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation)marked clinically by an enlarging lymph node or spleen

III. HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature B cells characterized by hairy cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 6.9)

C. Clinical features include splenomegaly (due to accumulation of hairy cells in red pulp) and "dry tap" on bone marrow aspiration (due to marrow fibrosis). Lymphadenopathy is usually absent.

D. Excellent response to 2-CDA (cladribine), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor; adenosine accumulates to toxic levels in neoplastic B cells.

IV.

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature CD4+ T cells

B. Results in high WBC count with hypercellular bone marrow 1. Cells of all myeloid lineages are increased; classified based on the dominant myeloid cell produced

C. Complications include 1.

Increased risk for hyperuricemia and gout due to high turnover of cells 2.

II. CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA (CML)

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially granulocytes and their precursors; basophils are characteristically increased (Fig. 6.11).

B. Driven by t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome) which generates a BCR-ABL fusion protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity.

1. First line treatment is imatinib, which blocks tyrosine kinase activity.

C. Splenomegaly is common. Enlarging spleen suggests progression to accelerated phase of disease; transformation to acute leukemia usually follows shortly thereafter.

1. Can transform to AML (2/3 of cases) or ALL (1/3 of cases) since mutation is in a pluripotent stem cell.

D. CML is distinguished from a leukemoid reaction (reactive neutrophilic leukocytosis) by 1.

Negative leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) stain (granulocytes in a leukemoid reaction are LAP positive) 2.

Increased basophils (absent with leukemoid reaction) 3.

III. POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (PV)

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially RBCs 1. Granulocytes and platelets are also increased.

Flushed face due to congestion (plethora) 4.

Itching, especially after bathing (due to histamine release from increased mast cells)

D. Treatment is phlebotomy; second-line therapy is hydroxyurea.

Fig. 6.11 Chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fig. 6.12 Essential thrombocythemia.

1. Without treatment, death usually occurs within one year.

E. PV must be distinguished from reactive polycythemia.

1.

In PV, erythropoietin (EPO) levels are decreased, and Sao is normal.

2.

In reactive polycythemia due to high altitude or lung disease, Sao2 is low, and EPO is increased.

3.

In reactive polycythemia due to ectopic EPO production from renal cell carcinoma, EPO is high, and Sao2 is normal.

IV.

A. Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially platelets (Fig. 6.12) 1. RBCs and granulocytes are also increased.

Painful LAD is usually seen in lymph nodes that are draining a region of acute infection (acute lymphadenitis).

2.

Painless LAD can be seen with chronic inflammation (chronic lymphadenitis), metastatic carcinoma, or lymphoma.

B. In inflammation, lymph node enlargement is due to hyperplasia of particular regions of the lymph node (Fig. 6.15).

2.

Lymph node is divided by bands of sclerosis (Fig. 6.19A); RS cells are present in lake-like spaces (lacunar cells, Fig. 6.19B).

E. Important considerations regarding other subtypes of HL 1. Lymphocyte-rich has the best prognosis of all types.

Fig. 6.18 Reed-Sternberg cell. Fig. 6.19 Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type. A, Sclerosis of lymph node. B, Reed-Sternberg cells in lacunar spaces.

2.

Mixed cellularity is often associated with abundant eosinophils (RS cells produce IL-5).

3.

Lymphocyte-depleted is the most aggressive of all types; usually seen in the elderly and HIV-positive individuals

I. MULTIPLE MYELOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow 1.

Most common primary malignancy of bone; metastatic cancer, however, is the most common malignant lesion of bone overall.

2.

B. Clinical features include 1.

Bone pain with hypercalcemia-Neoplastic plasma cells activate the RANK receptor on osteoclasts, leading to bone destruction. Lytic, 'punched-out' skeletal lesions are seen on x-ray (Fig. 6.20A), especially in the vertebrae and skull; increased risk for fracture 2.

Elevated serum protein-Neoplastic plasma cells produce immunoglobulin; M spike is present on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), most commonly due to monoclonal IgG or IgA.

3.

Increased risk of infection-Monoclonal antibody lacks antigenic diversity; infection is the most common cause of death in multiple myeloma.

4.

Rouleaux formation ofRBCs on blood smear-Increased serum protein decreases charge between RBCs (Fig. 6.20B).

5.

Primary AL amyloidosis-Free light chains circulate in serum and deposit in tissues.

6.

Proteinuria-Free light chain is excreted in the urine as Bence Jones protein; deposition in kidney tubules leads to risk for renal failure (myeloma kidney).

II. MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE (MGUS)

A. Increased serum protein with M spike on SPEP; other features of multiple myeloma are absent (e.g., no lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, AL amyloid, or Bence Jones proteinuria).

B. Common in elderly (seen in 5% of 70-year-old individuals); 1 % of patients with MGUS develop multiple myeloma each year.

III. WALDENSTROM MACROGLOBULINEMIA

Generalized lymphadenopathy; lytic bone lesions are absent.

2.

Increased serum protein with M spike (comprised oflgM) 3.

Visual and neurologic deficits (e.g., retinal hemorrhage or stroke)-IgM (large pentamer) causes serum hyperviscosity.

4.

Bleeding-Viscous serum results in defective platelet aggregation.

C. Acute complications are treated with plasmapheresis, which removes IgM from the serum.

4.

Biopsy reveals inflamed vessel wall with giant cells and intimal fibrosis (Fig. 7.2).

i. Lesions are segmental; diagnosis requires biopsy of a long segment of vessel, and a negative biopsy does not exclude disease.

5.

Lesions of varying stages are present. Early lesion consists of transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis (Fig. 7.3); eventually heals with fibrosis, producing a 'string-of-pearls' appearance on imaging 4.

Treatment is corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide; fatal if not treated

B. Kawasaki Disease 1.

2.

Presents with nonspecific signs including fever, conjunctivitis, erythematous rash of palms and soles, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes 3.

Coronary artery involvement is common and leads to risk for (1) thrombosis with myocardial infarction and (2) aneurysm with rupture.

Disease is self-limited, but may recur; treated with steroids, if severe

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Increased blood pressure; may involve pulmonary (see chapter 9) or systemic circulation

B. Systemic HTN is defined as pressure :2'. 140/90 mm Hg (normal ~ 120/80 mm Hg); divided into primary or secondary types based on etiology

II. PRIMARY HTN

A. HTN of unknown etiology (95% of cases)

B. Risk factors include age, race (increased risk in African Americans, decreased risk in Asians), obesity, stress, lack of physical activity, and high-salt diet.

III. SECONDARY HTN

A. HTN due to an identifiable etiology (5% ofcases)

B. Renal artery stenosis is a common cause (renovascular hypertension).

1.

Stenosis decreases blood flow to glomerulus.

2.

Juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) responds by secreting renin, which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.

3.

Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).

4.

ATII raises blood pressure by (1) contracting arteriolar smooth muscle, increasing total peripheral resistance and (2) promoting adrenal release of aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule (expanding plasma volume).

5.

Leads to HTN with increased plasma renin and unilateral atrophy (due to low blood flow) of the affected kidney; neither feature is seen in primary hypertension.

C. Important causes of stenosis include atherosclerosis (elderly males) and fibromuscular dysplasia (young females).

Fig. 7.4 Wegener granulomatosis. A, Necrotizing granuloma. B, Giant cells at edge of granuloma. Fig. 7.5 Atherosclerosis.

1. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a developmental defect of the blood vessel wall, resulting in irregular thickening of large-and medium-sized arteries, especially the renal artery.

IV. BENIGN AND MALIGNANT HTN

A. HTN can also be classified as benign or malignant.

B. Benign HTN is a mild or moderate elevation in blood pressure; most cases of HTN are benign.

1. Clinically silent; vessels and organs are damaged slowly over time.

C. Malignant HTN is severe elevation in blood pressure (> 180/120 mm Hg); comprises < 5% of cases 1.

2.

Presents with acute end-organ damage (e.g., acute renal failure, headache, and papilledema) and is a medical emergency

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Literally, "hard arteries;" due to thickening of the blood vessel wall

B. Three pathologic patterns-atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and Monckeberg medial calcific sclerosis

II. ATHEROSCLEROSIS

A. Intimal plaque that obstructs blood flow 1. Consists of a necrotic lipid core (mostly cholesterol) with a fibromuscular cap (Fig. 7.5); often undergoes dystrophic calcification

B. Involves large-and medium-sized arteries; abdominal aorta, coronary artery, popliteal artery, and internal carotid artery are commonly affected.

C. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are divided into modifiable and nonmodifiable.

1.

Modifiable risk factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia (LDL increases risk; HDL decreases risk), smoking, and diabetes.

2.

Nonmodifiable risk factors include age (number and severity of lesions increase with age), gender (increased risk in males and postmenopausal females; estrogen is protective), and genetics (multifactorial, but family history is highly predictive of risk).

D. Pathogenesis 1.

Damage to endothelium allows lipids to leak into the intima.

2.

Lipids are oxidized and then consumed by macrophages via scavenger receptors, resulting in foam cells.

Fig. 7.6 Atherosclerotic em bolus. (Courtesy of Fig. 7.7 Hyaline arteriolosclerosis. Fig. 7.8 Arteriolonephrosclerosis. (Courtesy of Professor A. Garfia) Jerome Taxy, MD) 3. Inflammation and healing leads to deposition of extracellular matrix and proliferation of smooth muscle.

E. Morphologic stages 1.

Begins as fatty streaks (flat yellow lesions of the intima consisting oflipid-laden macrophages); arise early in life (present in most teenagers) 2.

Progresses to atherosclerotic plaque

F. Complications of atherosclerosis account for > 50% of disease in Western countries.

1. Stenosis of medium-sized vessels results in impaired blood flow and ischemia leading to i. Peripheral vascular disease (lower extremity arteries, e.g., popliteal) ii. Angina (coronary arteries) iii. Ischemic bowel disease (mesenteric arteries) 2.

Plaque rupture with thrombosis results in myocardial infarction (coronary arteries) and stroke (e.g., middle cerebral artery).

3.

Plaque rupture with embolization results in atherosclerotic emboli, characterized by cholesterol crystals within the embolus (Fig. 7.6).

4.

Weakening of vessel wall results in aneurysm (e.g., abdominal aorta).

III. ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS

A. Narrowing of small arterioles; divided into hyaline and hyperplastic types

B. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is caused by proteins leaking into the vessel wall, producing vascular thickening; proteins are seen as pink hyaline on microscopy (Fig. 7.7).

1.

2.

Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia; classically produces glomerular scarring (arteriolonephrosclerosis, Fig. 7.8) that slowly progresses to chronic renal failure

C. Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis involves thickening of vessel wall by hyperplasia of smooth muscle ('onion-skin' appearance, Fig. 7.9).

1.

Consequence of malignant hypertension 2.

Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia 3.

May lead to fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall with hemorrhage; classically causes acute renal failure with a characteristic 'flea-bitten' appearance

IV. MONCKEBERG MEDIAL CALCIFIC SCLEROSIS

A. Calcification of the media of muscular (medium-sized) arteries; nonobstructive (Fig. 7.lOA)

B. Not clinically significant; seen as an incidental finding on x-ray or mammography (Fig. 7.lOB)

Fig. 7.9 Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis. Fig. 7.10 Monckeberg medial calcific sclerosis. A, Microscopic appearance. B, Mammogram.

I. AORTIC DISSECTION

A. Intimal tear with dissection of blood through media of the aortic wall (Fig. 7.11)

B. Occurs in the proximal 10 cm of the aorta (high stress region) with preexisting weakness of the media

C. Most common cause is hypertension (older adults); also associated with inherited defects of connective tissue (younger individuals) 1.

Hypertension results in hyaline arteriolosclerosis of the vasa vasorum; decreased flow causes atrophy of the media.

2.

Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome classically lead to weakness of the connective tissue in the media (cystic medial necrosis).

D. Presents as sharp, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back

E. Complications include pericardia! tamponade (most common cause of death), rupture with fatal hemorrhage, and obstruction of branching arteries (e.g., coronary or renal) with resultant end-organ ischemia.

II. THORACIC ANEURYSM

A. Balloon-like dilation of the thoracic aorta

B. Due to weakness in the aortic wall. Classically seen in tertiary syphilis; endarteritis of the vasa vasorum results in luminal narrowing, decreased flow, and atrophy of the vessel wall. Results in a 'tree-bark' appearance of the aorta (Fig. 7.12)

C. Major complication is dilation of the aortic valve root, resulting in aortic valve insufficiency.

1. Other complications include compression of mediastinal structures (e.g., airway or esophagus) and thrombosis/embolism.

III. ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM

A. Balloon-like dilation of the abdominal aorta; usually arises below the renal arteries, but above the aortic bifurcation (Fig. 7.13)

B. Primarily due to atherosclerosis; classically seen in male smokers > 60 years old with hypertension 1. Atherosclerosis increases the diffusion barrier to the media, resulting in atrophy and weakness of the vessel wall.

C. Presents as a pulsatile abdominal mass that grows with time

D. Major complication is rupture, especially when > 5 cm in diameter; presents with triad of hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, and flank pain 1. Other complications include compression oflocal structures (e.g., ureter) and thrombosis/embolism.

B. Commonly present at birth; often regresses during childhood

C. Most often involves skin and liver

II. ANGIOSARCOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of endothelial cells; highly aggressive

B. Common sites include skin, breast, and liver.

1. Liver angiosarcoma is associated with exposure to polyvinyl chloride, arsenic, and Thorotrast.

III. KAPOSI SARCOMA

A. Low-grade malignant proliferation of endothelial cells; associated with HHV-8

B. Presents as purple patches, plaques, and nodules on the skin (Fig. 7.15); may also involve visceral organs

C. Classically seen in 1.

Older Eastern European males-tumor remains localized to skin; treatment involves surgical removal.

2.

AIDS-tumor spreads early; treatment is antiretroviral agents (to boost immune system).

3.

Transplant recipients-tumor spreads early; treatment involves decreasing immunosuppression.

Fig. 7.14 Hemangioma. Fig. 7.15 Kaposi sarcoma.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Group of syndromes related to myocardial ischemia; IHD is the leading cause of death in the US.

B. Usually due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, which decreases blood flow to the myocardium 1. Risk factors for IHD are similar to those of atherosclerosis; incidence increases with age.

II. ANGINA

A. Stable angina is chest pain that arises with exertion or emotional stress.

1.

Due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries with > 70% stenosis; decreased blood flow is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the myocardium during exertion.

2.

Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3.

Presents as chest pain (lasting < 20 minutes) that radiates to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath 4.

EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia.

5.

B. Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs at rest.

1.

Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.lA).

2.

Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3.

EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia.

4.

5.

High risk of progression to myocardial infarction

C. Prinzmetal angina is episodic chest pain unrelated to exertion.

1.

Due to coronary artery vasospasm 2.

Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 3.

EKG shows ST-segment elevation due to transmural ischemia.

4.

III. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

A. Necrosis of cardiac myocytes

B. Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and complete occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.lB) 1. Other causes include coronary artery vasospasm (due to Prinzmetal angina or cocaine use), emboli, and vasculitis (e.g., Kawasaki disease).

C. Clinical features include severe, crushing chest pain (lasting > 20 minutes) that radiates to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, and dyspnea; symptoms are not relieved by nitroglycerin.

D. Infarction usually involves the left ventricle (LV); right ventricle (RV) and both atria are generally spared.

pathoma.com 1.

Occlusion ofleft anterior descending artery (LAD) leads to infarction of the anterior wall and anterior septum of the LV; LAD is the most commonly involved artery in MI (45% of cases).

2.

Occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) leads to infarction of the posterior wall, posterior septum, and papillary muscles of the LV; RCA is the 2nd most commonly involved artery in MI.

3.

Occlusion of left circumflex artery leads to infarction of lateral wall of the L V.

E. Initial phase of infarction leads to subendocardial necrosis involving < 50% of the myocardial thickness (subendocardial infarction, Fig. 8.2); EKG shows ST-segment depression.

1. Continued or severe ischemia leads to transmural necrosis involving most of the myocardial wall (transmural infarction); EKG shows ST-segment elevation.

F. Laboratory tests detect elevated cardiac enzymes.

1.

Troponin I is the most sensitive and specific marker (gold standard) for MI. Levels rise 2-4 hours after infarction, peak at 24 hours, and return to normal by 7-10 days.

2.

CK-MB is useful for detecting reinfarction that occurs days after an initial Ml; creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels rise 4-6 hours after infarction, peak at 24 hours, and return to normal by 72 hours.

G. Treatment includes 1. Aspirin and/or heparin-limits thrombosis 2. Supplemental 0 2-minimizes ischemia 3.

4.

~-blocker-slows heart rate, decreasing 0 demand and risk for arrhythmia 5.

6.

i. Reperfusion of irreversibly-damaged cells results in calcium influx, leading to hypercontraction of myofibrils (contraction band necrosis, Fig. 8.3).

ii. Return of oxygen and inflammatory cells may lead to free radical generation, further damaging myocytes (reperfusion injury).

H. Complications of myocardial infarction are closely related to gross and microscopic changes (Table 8.1).

Table 8.1: Morphologic Changes in Myocardial Infarction ~~~::c~;~N GROSS CHANGES MICROSCOPIC CHANGES COMPLICATIONS

IV.

A. Unexpected death due to cardiac disease; occurs without symptoms or < 1 hour after symptoms arise 1. Usually due to fatal ventricular arrhythmia

B. Most common etiology is acute ischemia; 90% of patients have preexisting severe atherosclerosis.

1. Less common causes include mitral valve prolapse, cardiomyopathy, and cocaine abuse.

V.

A. Poor myocardial function due to chronic ischemic damage (with or without infarction); progresses to congestive heart failure (CHF)

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Pump failure; divided into right-and left-sided failure

II. LEFT-SIDED HEART FAILURE

A. Causes include ischemia, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

B. Clinical features are due to decreased forward perfusion and pulmonary congestion.

1. Pulmonary congestion leads to pulmonary edema.

i. Results in dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (due to increased venous return when lying flat), orthopnea, and crackles ii. Small, congested capillaries may burst, leading to intraalveolar hemorrhage; marked by hemosiderin-laden macrophages ('heart-failure' cells, Fig. 8.8) 2. Decreased flow to kidneys leads to activation of renin-angiotensin system.

i. Fluid retention exacerbates CHF.

C. Mainstay of treatment is ACE inhibitor.

III. RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE

A. Most commonly due to left-sided heart failure; other important causes include leftto-right shunt and chronic lung disease (cor pulmonale).

B. Clinical features are due to congestion.

1.

2.

Painful hepatosplenomegaly with characteristic 'nutmeg' liver (Fig. 8.9); may lead to cardiac cirrhosis 3.

Dependent pitting edema (due to increased hydrostatic pressure)

Fig. 8.8 Hemosiderin-laden macrophages ('heart Fig. 8.9 'Nutmeg' liver, congestive heart failure. Fig. 8.10 'Boot-shaped' heart, tetralogy of Fallot. failure' cells).

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Arise during embryogenesis (usually weeks 3 through 8); seen in 1% of live births 1. Most defects are sporadic.

B. Often result in shunting between left (systemic) and right (pulmonary) circulations.

C. Defects with left-to-right shunting may be relatively asymptomatic at birth, but the shunt can eventually reverse.

1.

Increased flow through the pulmonary circulation results in hypertrophy of pulmonary vessels and pulmonary hypertension.

2.

Increased pulmonary resistance eventually results in reversal of shunt, leading to late cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome) with right ventricular hypertrophy, polycythemia, and clubbing.

D. Defects with right-to-left shunting usually present as cyanosis shortly after birth.

II. VENTRICULAR SEPT AL DEFECT (VSD)

A. Defect in the septum that divides the right and left ventricles 1.

2.

Associated with fetal alcohol syndrome

B. Results in left-to-right shunt; size of defect determines extent of shunting and age at presentation. Small defects are often asymptomatic; large defects can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome.

C. Treatment involves surgical closure; small defects may close spontaneously.

III. ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)

A. Defect in the septum that divides right and left atria; most common type is ostium secundum (90% of cases).

B. Ostium primum type is associated with Down syndrome.

C. Results in left-to-right shunt and split S2 on auscultation (increased blood in right heart delays closure of pulmonary valve)

D. Paradoxical emboli are an important complication.

IV.

A. Failure of ductus arteriosus to close; associated with congenital rubella

B. Results in left-to-right shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary artery 1. During development, the ductus arteriosus normally shunts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs.

C. Asymptomatic at birth with continuous 'machine-like' murmur; may lead to Eisenmenger syndrome, resulting in lower extremity cyanosis

D. Treatment involves indomethacin, which decreases PGE, resulting in PDA closure (PGE maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus).

V.

A. Characterized by (1) stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, (2) right ventricular hypertrophy, (3) VSD, and (4) an aorta that overrides the VSD

B. Right-to-left shunt leads to early cyanosis; degree of stenosis determines the extent of shunting and cyanosis.

C. Patients learn to squat in response to a cyanotic spell; increased arterial resistance decreases shunting and allows more blood to reach the lungs.

D. 'Boot-shaped' heart on x-ray (Fig. 8.10)

VI. TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT VESSELS

A. Characterized by pulmonary artery arising from the left ventricle and aorta arising from the right ventricle B. Associated with maternal diabetes

C. Presents with early cyanosis; pulmonary and systemic circuits do not mix.

1.

Creation of shunt (allowing blood to mix) after birth is required for survival.

2.

PGE can be administered to maintain a PDA until definitive surgical repair is performed.

D. Results in hypertrophy of the right ventricle and atrophy of the left ventricle

VII. TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS

A. Characterized by a single large vessel arising from both ventricles 1. Truncus fails to divide.

B. Presents with early cyanosis; deoxygenated blood from right ventricle mixes with oxygenated blood from left ventricle before pulmonary and aortic circulations separate.

VIII. TRI CUSPID ATRESIA

A. Tricuspid valve orifice fails to develop; right ventricle is hypoplastic.

B. Often associated with ASD, resulting in a right-to-left shunt; presents with early cyanosis.

IX. COARCTATION OF THE AORTA

A. Narrowing of the aorta (Fig. 8.llA); classically divided into infantile and adult forms

B. Infantile form is associated with a PDA; coarctation lies after (distal to) the aortic arch, but before (proximal to) the PDA.

1.

Presents as lower extremity cyanosis in infants, often at birth 2.

Associated with Turner syndrome

C. Adult form is not associated with a PDA; coarctation lies after (distal to) the aortic arch.

1.

Presents as hypertension in the upper extremities and hypotension with weak pulses in the lower extremities; classically discovered in adulthood 2.

Collateral circulation develops across the intercostal arteries; engorged arteries cause 'notching' of ribs on x-ray (Fig. 8.llB), 3.

Associated with bicuspid aortic valve

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. The heart has four valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic) that prevent backflow.

B. Valvular lesions generally result in stenosis (decreased caliber of the valve orifice) or regurgitation (backflow).

II. ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER

A. Systemic complication of pharyngitis due to group A ~-hemolytic streptococci; affects children 2-3 weeks after an episode ofstreptococcal pharyngitis ("strep throat")

B. Caused by molecular mimicry; bacterial M protein resembles proteins in human tissue.

C. Diagnosis is based on Jones criteria.

1.

Evidence of prior group A ~-hemolytic streptococcal infection (e.g., elevated ASO or anti-DNase B titers) with the presence of major and minor criteria 2.

Minor criteria are nonspecific and include fever and elevated ESR.

3.

i. Migratory polyarthritis-swelling and pain in a large joint (e.g., wrist, knees, ankles) that resolves within days and "migrates" to involve another large joint 11. Pancarditis a.

Endocarditis-Mitral valve is involved more commonly than the aortic valve. Characterized by small vegetations along lines of closure that lead to regurgitation (Fig. 8.12A) b.

Myocarditis with Aschoff bodies that are characterized by foci of chronic inflammation, reactive histiocytes with slender, wavy nuclei (Anitschkow cells), giant cells, and fibrinoid material (Fig. 8.12B,C); myocarditis is the most common cause of death during the acute phase.

c.

B. Results in stenosis with a classic 'fish-mouth ' appearance 1.

Almost always involves the mitral valve; leads to thickening of chordae tendineae and cusps 2.

IV.

A. Narrowing of the aortic valve orifice (Fig. 8.14)

B. Usually due to fibrosis and calcification from "wear and tear" 1.

2.

Bicuspid aortic valve increases risk and hastens disease onset. A normal aortic valve has three cusps; fewer cusps results in increased "wear and tear" on each cusp.

C. May also arise as a consequence of chronic rheumatic valve disease; coexisting mitral stenosis and fusion of the aortic valve commissures distinguish rheumatic disease from "wear and tear."

D. Cardiac compensation leads to a prolonged asymptomatic stage during which a systolic ejection click followed by a crescendo-decrescendo murmur is heard.

E. Complications include 1.

Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy-may progress to cardiac failure 2.

Angina and syncope with exercise-Limited ability to increase blood flow across the stenotic valve leads to decreased perfusion of the myocardium and brain.

Community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia superimposed on COPD (leads to exacerbation of COPD)

Community-acquired pneumonia, pneumonia superimposed on COPD, or pneumonia in immunocompromised states; transmitted from water source Intracellular organism that is best visualized by silver stain

Table 9.3: Causes of Interstitial (Atypical) Pneumonia

Most common cause of atypical pneumonia, usually affects young adults (classically, military recruits or college students living in a dormitory). Complications include autoimmune hemolytic anemia (IgM against I antigen on RBCs causes cold hemolytic anemia) and erythema multiforme. Not visible on gram stain due to lack ofcell wall

Second most common cause of atypical pneumonia in young adults

Most common cause of atypical pneumonia in infants

Atypical pneumonia with posttransplant immunosuppression or chemotherapy

Atypical pneumonia in the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting lung disease. Also increases the risk for superimposed S aureus or H influenzae bacterial pneumonia

Atypical pneumonia with high fever (Q fever); seen in farmers and veterinarians (Coxiella spores are deposited on cattle by ticks or are present in cattle placentas). Coxiella is a rickettsial organism, but it is distinct from most rickettsiae because it (1) causes pneumonia, (2) does not require arthropod vector for transmission (survives as highly heat-resistant endospores), and (3) does not produce a skin rash.

C. Classically results in a right lower lobe abscess 1. Anatomically, the right main stem bronchus branches at a less acute angle than the left.

VI. TUBERCULOSIS (TB)

C. Secondary TB arises with reactivation ofMycobacterium tuberculosis.

1.

Reactivation is commonly due to AIDS; may also be seen with aging 2.

5.

Biopsy reveals caseating granulomas; AFB stain reveals acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 9.6B,C).

6.

Systemic spread often occurs and can involve any tissue; common sites include meninges (meningitis), cervical lymph nodes, kidneys (sterile pyuria), and lumbar vertebrae (Pott disease).

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Group of diseases characterized by airway obstruction; lung does not empty, and air is trapped.

1. Volume ofair that can be forcefully expired is decreased (-.I, FVC), especially during the first second ofexpiration (-.l,-.l, FEV); results in -.I, FEV :FVC ratio 2. Total lung capacity (TLC) is usually increased due to air trapping.

II. CHRONIC BRONCHITIS

A. Chronic productive cough lasting at least 3 months over a minimum of 2 years; highly associated with smoking

B. Characterized by hypertrophy of bronchial mucous glands (Fig. 9.7)

Fig. 9.6 Tuberculosis. A, Ghon focus. B, Caseating granuloma. C, AFB staining of M tuberculosis. (A, Courtesy of Ya le Rosen, MD) 1. Leads to increased thickness of mucus glands relative to bronchial wall thickness (Reid index increases to > 50%; normal is < 40%).

C. Clinical features 1.

Productive cough due to excessive mucus production 2.

Cyanosis ('blue bloaters')-Mucus plugs trap carbon dioxide; t Paco2 and ..I.-Pao2 3.

Increased risk of infection and cor pulmonale

III. EMPHYSEMA

A. Destruction of alveolar air sacs (Fig. 9.8) 1. Loss of elastic recoil and collapse of airways during exhalation results in obstruction and air trapping.

B. Due to imbalance of proteases and anti proteases 1.

Inflammation in the lung normally leads to release of proteases by neutrophils and macrophages.

2.

a -anti trypsin (Al AT) neutralizes proteases.

3.

Excessive inflammation or lack of AlAT leads to destruction of the alveolar air sacs.

C. Smoking is the most common cause of emphysema.

1.

Pollutants in smoke lead to excessive inflammation and protease-mediated damage.

2.

Results in centriacinar emphysema that is most severe in the upper lobes

D. AlAT deficiency is a rare cause of emphysema.

1.

Lack of antiprotease leaves the air sacs vulnerable to protease-mediated damage.

2.

Results in panacinar emphysema that is most severe in the lower lobes 3.

Liver cirrhosis may also be present.

i. Al AT deficiency is due to misfolding of the mutated protein.

ii. Mutant AlAT accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum ofhepatocytes, resulting in liver damage.

111. Biopsy reveals pink, PAS-positive globules in hepatocytes (Fig. 9.9).

4.

Disease severity is based on the degree of AlAT deficiency.

i. PiM is the normal allele; two copies are usually expressed (PiMM).

ii. PiZ is the most common clinically relevant mutation; results in significantly low levels of circulating AlAT iii. PiMZ heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic with decreased circulating levels of AlAT; however, significant risk for emphysema with smoking exists.

iv. PiZZ homozygotes are at significant risk for panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis.

IV.

A. Reversible airway bronchoconstriction, most often due to allergic stimuli (atopic asthma)

B. Presents in childhood; often associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema, and a family history of atopy

C. Pathogenesis (type I hypersensitivity) 1.

Allergens induce T H2 phenotype in CD4+ T cells of genetically susceptible individuals.

2.

T H2 cells secrete IL-4 (mediates class switch to IgE), IL-5 (attracts eosinophils), and IL-10 (stimulates T H2 cells and inhibits T Hl).

3.

Reexposure to allergen leads to IgE-mediated activation of mast cells.

i. Release of preformed histamine granules and generation ofleukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 lead to bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and edema (earlyphase reaction).

ii. Inflammation, especially major basic protein derived from eosinophils, damages cells and perpetuates bronchoconstriction (late-phase reaction).

D. Clinical features are episodic and related to allergen exposure.

1.

2.

Productive cough, classically with spiral-shaped mucus plugs (Curschmann spirals) and eosinophil-derived crystals (Charcot-Leyden crystals, Fig. 9.11).

3.

Severe, unrelenting attack can result in status asthmaticus and death.

E. Asthma may also arise from nonallergic causes (non-atopic asthma) such as exercise, viral infection, aspirin (e.g., aspirin intolerant asthma), and occupational exposures.

V.

A. Permanent dilatation of bronchi (Fig. 9.12); loss of airway tone results in air trapping.

B. Due to severe inflammation with damage to airway walls. Causes include 1.

2.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia-inherited defect of the dynein arm, which is necessary for ciliary movement. Associated with sinusitis, infertility (poor motility of sperm), and situs inversus (position of major organs is reversed, e.g., heart is on right side of thorax), which is called Kartagener syndrome

II. IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS

A. Fibrosis oflung interstitium (Fig. 9.13)

B. Etiology is unknown. Likely related to cyclical lung injury; TGF-~ from injured pneumocytes induces fibrosis.

1. Secondary causes of interstitial fibrosis such as drugs (e.g., bleomycin and amiodarone) and radiation therapy must be excluded.

C. Clinical features 1.

2.

Bilateral fibrosis on lung CT; initially seen in subpleural patches, but eventually results in extensive fibrosis with end-stage 'honeycomb' lung 3.

4.

Definitive treatment is lung transplantation.

III. PNEUMOCONIOSES

A. Interstitial fibrosis due to occupational exposure; requires chronic exposure to small particles that are fibrogenic (Table 9.4) 1. Alveolar macrophages engulf foreign particles and induce fibrosis.

Fibrosis oflung and pleura (plaques) with increased risk for Asbestos fibers; seen in lung carcinoma and mesothelioma;Asbestosis construction workers, plumbers, lung carcinoma is more commonand shipyard workers than mesothelioma in exposed individuals.

B. Etiology is unknown; likely due to CD4 • helper T-cell response to an unknown antigen

C. Granulomas most commonly involve the hilar lymph nodes and lung (Fig. 9.15A), leading to restrictive lung disease.

1. Characteristic stellate inclusions ('asteroid bodies') are often seen within giant cells of the granulomas (Fig. 9.15B).

D. Other commonly involved tissues include the uvea (uveitis), skin (cutaneous nodules or erythema nodosum), and salivary and lacrimal glands (mimics Sjogren syndrome); almost any tissue can be involved.

E. Clinical features 1.

2.

3.

Hypercalcemia (I-alpha hydroxylase activity of epithelioid histiocytes converts vitamin D to its active form) 4.

Treatment is immunosuppression; often resolves spontaneously without treatment.

Mild exposure to carbon (e.g., pollution) results in anthracosis (collections of carbon-laden macrophages); not clinically significant

Increased risk for TB; silica impairs phagolysosome formation by macrophages.

Lesions may contain long, goldenbrown fibers with associated iron (asbestos bodies, Fig. 9.14), which confirm exposure to asbestos

V. HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS

A. Granulomatous reaction to inhaled organic antigens (e.g., pigeon breeder's lung)

B. Presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea hours after exposure; resolves with removal of the exposure

C. Chronic exposure leads to interstitial fibrosis.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. High pressure in the pulmonary circuit (mean arterial pressure > 25 mm Hg; normal is 10 mm Hg)

B. Characterized by atherosclerosis of the pulmonary trunk, smooth muscle hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries, and intimal fibrosis; plexiform lesions are seen with severe, long-standing disease (Fig. 9.16).

C. Leads to right ventricular hypertrophy with eventual cor pulmonale

D. Presents with exertional dyspnea or right-sided heart failure

E. Subclassified as primary or secondary based on etiology

II. PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

A. Classically seen in young adult females

B. Etiology is unknown; some familial forms are related to inactivating mutations of BMPR2, leading to proliferation ofvascular smooth muscle.

III. SECONDARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

A. Due to hypoxemia (e.g., COPD and interstitial lung disease) or increased volume in the pulmonary circuit (e.g., congenital heart disease); may also arise with recurrent pulmonary embolism

I. ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

A. Diffuse damage to the alveolar-capillary interface (diffuse alveolar damage)

B. Leakage of protein-rich fluid leads to edema that combines with necrotic epithelial cells to form hyaline membranes lining alveoli (Fig. 9.17A).

C. Clinical features 1.

Fig. 9.16 Plexiform lesion, primary pulmonary Fig. 9.17 ARDS. A, Hyaline membranes. B, 'White-out' of lung on x-ray. (B, Courtesy of Samir, GNUhypertension. FDL vl.2) 1. Activation of neutrophils induces protease-and free radical-mediated damage of type I and II pneumocytes.

E. Treatment 1.

2.

Ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)

F. Recovery may be complicated by interstitial fibrosis; damage and loss of type II pneumocytes leads to scarring and fibrosis.

II. NEONATAL RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

A. Respiratory distress due to inadequate surfactant levels 1.

Surfactant is made by type II pneumocytes; phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is the major component.

2.

Surfactant decreases surface tension in the lung, preventing collapse of alveolar air sacs after expiration.

3.

Lack of surfactant leads to collapse of air sacs and formation of hyaline membranes.

B. Associated with 1. Prematurity-Surfactant production begins at 28 weeks; adequate levels are not reached until 34 weeks.

i. Amniotic fluid lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio is used to screen for lung maturity.

ii. Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) levels increase as surfactant is produced; sphingomyelin remains constant.

iii. A ratio > 2 indicates adequate surfactant production.

2.

Caesarian section delivery-due to lack of stress-induced steroids; steroids increase synthesis of surfactant.

3.

Maternal diabetes-Insulin decreases surfactant production.

C. Clinical features 1.

Increasing respiratory effort after birth, tachypnea with use of accessory muscles, and grunting 2.

Hypoxemia with cyanosis 3.

Diffuse granularity of the lung ('ground-glass' appearance) on x-ray (Fig. 9.18)

D. Complications 1.

Hypoxemia increases the risk for persistence of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis.

2.

Supplemental oxygen increases the risk for free radical injury. Retinal injury leads to blindness; lung damage leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Most common cause of cancer mortality in the US; average age at presentation is 60 years.

B. Key risk factors are cigarette smoke, radon, and asbestos.

1. Cigarette smoke contains over 60 carcinogens; 85% oflung cancer occurs in smokers.

i. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic are particularly mutagenic.

ii. Cancer risk is directly related to the duration and amount of smoking ('packyears').

2. Radon is formed by radioactive decay of uranium, which is present in soil.

i. Accumulates in closed spaces such as basements ii. Responsible for most of the public exposure to ionizing radiation; 2nd most frequent cause oflung carcinoma in US iii. Increased risk of lung cancer is also seen in uranium miners.

3. Environmental toxins include asbestos, coal fueled stoves, and metals (arsenic, chromium, and nickel)

C. Presenting symptoms are nonspecific (e.g., cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss, and post-obstructive pneumonia).

D. Imaging usually reveals a large, spiculated mass; however, a solitary nodule ('coinlesion') can be seen. Biopsy is necessary for a diagnosis of cancer.

1. Benign lesions may also produce a 'coin-lesion,' especially in younger patients. Examples include i. Granuloma-often due to TB or fungus (especially Histoplasma in the Midwest) ii. Bronchial hamartoma-benign tumor composed oflung tissue and cartilage; often calcified on imaging

E. Lung carcinoma is classically divided into 2 categories (Table 9.5).

I. CLEFT LIP AND PALATE

A. Full-thickness defect of lip or palate (Fig. 10.1)

B. Due to failure of facial prominences to fuse 1. During early pregnancy, facial prominences (one from superior, two from the sides, and two from inferior) grow and fuse together to form the face.

C. Cleft lip and palate usually occur together; isolated cleft lip or palate is less common.

II. APHTHOUS ULCER

A. Painful, superficial ulceration of the oral mucosa (Fig. 10.2)

B. Arises in relation to stress and resolves spontaneously, but often recurs

C. Characterized by a grayish base surrounded by erythema

A. Recurrent aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis

B. Due to immune complex vasculitis involving small vessels

C. Can be seen after viral infection, but etiology is unknown

IV.

A. Vesicles involving oral mucosa that rupture, resulting in shallow, painful, red ulcers

B. Usually due to HSV-1

C. Primary infection occurs in childhood; lesions heal, but virus remains dormant in ganglia of the trigeminal nerve.

V.

A. Malignant neoplasm of squamous cells lining the oral mucosa

B. Tobacco and alcohol are major risk factors.

C. Floor of mouth is the most common location.

D. Oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia are precursor lesions.

1.

Leukoplakia is a white plaque that cannot be scraped away; often represents squamous cell dysplasia 2.

Leukoplakia is distinct from oral candidiasis (thrush) and hairy leukoplakia.

i. Oral candidiasis is a white deposit on the tongue, which is easily scraped away (Fig. 10.4); usually seen in immunocompromised states ii. Hairy leukoplakia is a white, rough ('hairy') patch that arises on the lateral tongue. It is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., AIDS) and is due to EBY-induced squamous cell hyperplasia; not pre-malignant 3.

Erythroplakia (red plaque) represents vascularized leukoplakia and is highly suggestive of squamous cell dysplasia.

4.

Erythroplakia and leukoplakia are often biopsied to rule out carcinoma.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Salivary glands are exocrine glands that secrete saliva.

B. Divided into major (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands) and minor glands (hundreds of microscopic glands distributed throughout the oral mucosa)

II. MUMPS

A. Infection with mumps virus resulting in bilateral inflamed parotid glands

B. Orchitis, pancreatitis, and aseptic meningitis may also be present.

1.

Serum amylase is increased due to salivary gland or pancreatic involvement.

2.

Orchitis carries risk of sterility, especially in teenagers.

III. SIALADENITIS

A. Inflammation of the salivary gland

B. Most commonly due to an obstructing stone (sialolithiasis) leading to Staphylococcus aureus infection; usually unilateral

IV.

A. Benign tumor composed of stromal (e.g., cartilage) and epithelial tissue; most common tumor of the salivary gland

B. Usually arises in parotid; presents as a mobile, painless, circumscribed mass at the angle of the jaw

C. High rate of recurrence; extension of small islands of tumor through tumor capsule often leads to incomplete resection (Fig. 10.5).

D. Rarely may transform into carcinoma, which presents with signs of facial nerve damage (facial nerve runs through parotid gland)

V.

A. Benign cystic tumor with abundant lymphocytes and germinal centers (lymph node-like stroma); 2nd most common tumor of the salivary gland

IV.

A. Acidic damage to the stomach mucosa

B. Due to imbalance between mucosa! defenses and acidic environment 1. Defenses include mucin layer produced by foveolar cells, bicarbonate secretion by surface epithelium, and normal blood supply (provides nutrients and picks up leaked acid).

C. Risk factors 1.

Severe burn (Curling ulcer)-Hypovolemia leads to decreased blood supply.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Increased intracranial pressure (Cushing ulcer)-Increased stimulation ofvagus nerve leads to increased acid production.

6.

Shock-Multiple (stress) ulcers may be seen in ICU patients.

D. Acid damage results in superficial inflammation, erosion (loss of superficial epithelium), or ulcer (loss of mucosa! layer).

V.

A. Chronic inflammation of stomach mucosa

B. Divided into two types based on underlying etiology: chronic autoimmune gastritis and chronic H pylori gastritis

C. Chronic autoimmune gastritis is due to autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells, which are located in the stomach body and fundus.

1.

Associated with antibodies against parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor; useful for diagnosis, but pathogenesis is mediated by T cells (type IV hypersensitivity) 2.

i. Atrophy of mucosa with intestinal metaplasia (Fig. 10.11) ii. Achlorhydria with increased gastrin levels and antral G-cell hyperplasia iii. Megaloblastic (pernicious) anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor iv. Increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type)

D. Chronic H pylori gastritis is due to H pylori-induced acute and chronic inflammation; most common form of gastritis (90%) 1.

H pylori ureases and proteases along with inflammation weaken mucosa! defenses; antrum is the most common site (Fig. 10.12).

2.

Presents with epigastric abdominal pain; increased risk for ulceration (peptic ulcer disease), gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type), and MALT lymphoma 3.

Treatment involves triple therapy.

i. Resolves gastritis/ulcer and reverses intestinal metaplasia ii. Negative urea breath test and lack of stool antigen confirm eradication of

Hpylori.

VI. PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

A. Solitary mucosa! ulcer involving proximal duodenum (90%) or distal stomach (10%)

B. Duodenal ulcer is almost always due to H pylori (> 95%); rarely, may be due to ZE syndrome 1.

Presents with epigastric pain that improves with meals 2.

Diagnostic endoscopic biopsy shows ulcer with hypertrophy of Brunner glands.

3.

Usually arises in anterior duodenum; when present in posterior duodenum, rupture may lead to bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery or acute pancreatitis

C. Gastric ulcer is usually due to H pylori (75%); other causes include NSAIDs and bile reflux.

1.

Presents with epigastric pain that worsens with meals 2.

Ulcer is usually located on the lesser curvature of the antrum.

3.

Rupture carries risk of bleeding from left gastric artery.

D. Differential diagnosis of ulcers includes carcinoma.

1.

Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant (duodenal carcinoma is extremely rare).

2.

Gastric ulcers can be caused by gastric carcinoma (intestinal subtype).

i. Benign peptic ulcers are usually small (< 3 cm), sharply demarcated ("punched-out"), and surrounded by radiating folds of mucosa (Fig. 10.13A).

11. Malignant ulcers are large and irregular with heaped up margins (Fig. 10.13B) iii. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.

VII. GASTRIC CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of surface epithelial cells (adenocarcinoma)

B. Subclassified into intestinal and diffuse types

C. Intestinal type (more common) presents as a large, irregular ulcer with heaped up margins; most commonly involves the lesser curvature of the antrum (similar to gastric ulcer) 1. Risk factors include intestinal metaplasia (e.g., due to H pylori and autoimmune gastritis), nitrosamines in smoked foods (Japan), and blood type A.

D. Diffuse type is characterized by signet ring cells that diffusely infiltrate the gastric wall (Fig. 10.14B); desmoplasia results in thickening of stomach wall (linitis plastica, Fig. 10.14A).

1. Not associated with H pylori, intestinal metaplasia, or nitrosamines

E. Gastric carcinoma presents late with weight loss, abdominal pain, anemia, and early satiety; rarely presents as acanthosis nigricans or Leser-Trelat sign

F. Spread to lymph nodes can involve the left supraclavicular node (Virchow node).

G. Distant metastasis most commonly involves liver; other sites include 1. Periumbilical region (Sister Mary Joseph nodule); seen with intestinal type

B. Associated with a leading edge (focus of traction) 1.

In children, the most common cause is lymphoid hyperplasia (e.g., due to rotavirus); usually arises in the terminal ileum, leading to intussusception into the cecum 2.

In adults, the most common cause is tumor.

V.

A. Small bowel is highly susceptible to ischemic injury.

1.

Transmural infarction occurs with thrombosis/embolism of the superior mesenteric artery or thrombosis of the mesenteric vein.

2.

Mucosa! infarction occurs with marked hypotension.

B. Clinical features include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and decreased bowel sounds.

VI. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE

A. Decreased function of the lactase enzyme found in the brush border of enterocytes 1. Lactase normally breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose.

B. Presents with abdominal distension and diarrhea upon consumption of milk products; undigested lactose is osmotically active.

C. Deficiency may be congenital (rare autosomal recessive disorder) or acquired (often develops in late childhood); temporary deficiency is seen after small bowel infection (]actase is highly susceptible to injury).

VII. CELIAC DISEASE

A. Immune-mediated damage of small bowel villi due to gluten exposure; associated with HLA-DQ2 and DQS

B. Gluten is present in wheat and grains; its most pathogenic component is gliadin.

1.

Once absorbed, gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG).

2.

Deamidated gliadin is presented by antigen presenting cells via MHC class II.

3.

Helper T cells mediate tissue damage.

C. Clinical presentation 1.

Children classically present with abdominal distension, diarrhea, and failure to thrive.

2.

Adults classically present with chronic diarrhea and bloating.

3.

Small, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin (dermatitis herpetiformis). Due to IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillae; resolves with gluten-free diet

D. Laboratory findings 1.

IgA antibodies against endomysium, tTG, or gliadin; IgG antibodies are also present and are useful for diagnosis in individuals with IgA deficiency (increased incidence ofigA deficiency is seen in celiac disease).

2.

Duodenal biopsy reveals flattening of villi, hyperplasia of crypts, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Fig. 10.18). Damage is most prominent in the duodenum; jejunum and ileum are less involved.

E. Symptoms resolve with gluten-free diet.

1. Small bowel carcinoma and T-cell lymphoma are late complications that present as refractory disease despite good dietary control.

Fig. 10.18 Celiac disease. A, Flattened villi. B, Normal villi for comparison.

VIII.TROPICAL SPRUE

A. Damage to small bowel villi due to an unknown organism resulting in malabsorption

B. Similar to celiac disease except 1.

Occurs in tropical regions (e.g., Caribbean) 2.

Arises after infectious diarrhea and responds to antibiotics 3.

Damage is most prominent in jejunum and ileum (secondary vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may ensue); duodenum is less commonly involved.

IX.

A. Systemic tissue damage characterized by macrophages loaded with Tropheryma whippelii organisms; partially destroyed organisms are present in macrophage lysosomes (positive for PAS).

B. Classic site of involvement is the small bowel lamina propria (Fig. 10.19).

1.

Macrophages compress lacteals.

2.

Chylomicrons cannot be transferred from enterocytes to lymphatics.

3.

C. Other common sites ofinvolvement include synovium ofjoints (arthritis), cardiac valves, lymph nodes, and CNS.

X.

A. Autosomal recessive deficiency of apolipoprotein B-48 and B-100

B. Clinical features 1.

Malabsorption-due to defective chylomicron formation (requires B-48) 2.

XI. CARCINOID TUMOR

A. Malignant proliferation of neuroendocrine cells; low-grade malignancy 1. Tumor cells contain neurosecretory granules that are positive for chromogranin.

B. Can arise anywhere along the gut; small bowel is the most common site.

1. Grows as a submucosal polyp-like nodule (Fig. 10.20)

C. Often secretes serotonin 1.

Serotonin is released into the portal circulation and metabolized by liver monoamine oxidase (MAO) into 5-HIAA.

2.

5-HIAA is excreted in the urine.

D. Metastasis of carcinoid tumor to the liver allows serotonin to bypass liver metabolism.

1. Serotonin is released into the hepatic vein and leaks into systemic circulation via hepato-systemic shunts, resulting in carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid heart disease.

Fig. 10.19 Whipple disease. A, Macrophages within lamina propria of small bowel villi. B, Twhippelii Fig. 10.20 Carcinoid tumor. organisms highlighted by PAS stain.

2.

Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by bronchospasm, diarrhea, and flushing of skin; symptoms can be triggered by alcohol or emotional stress, which stimulate serotonin release from the tumor.

3.

Carcinoid heart disease is characterized by right-sided valvular fibrosis (increased collagen) leading to tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary valve stenosis; left-sided valvular lesions are not seen due to presence of monoamine oxidase (metabolizes serotonin) in the lung.

I. ACUTE APPENDICITIS

A. Acute inflammation of the appendix; most common cause of acute abdomen

B. Related to obstruction of the appendix by lymphoid hyperplasia (children) or a fecalith (adults)

C. Clinical features include 1.

Periumbilical pain, fever, and nausea; pain eventually localizes to right lower quadrant (McBurney point).

2.

Rupture results in peritonitis that presents with guarding and rebound tenderness.

3.

Periappendiceal abscess is a common complication.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Chronic, relapsing inflammation of bowel

B. Possibly due to abnormal immune response to enteric flora

C. Classically presents in young women (teens to 30s) as recurrent bouts of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain 1. More prevalent in the West, particularly in Caucasians and Eastern European Jews

D. Diagnosis of exclusion; symptoms mimic other causes of bowel inflammation (e.g., infection).

E. Subclassified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease (Table 10.1)

I. HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE

A. Defective relaxation and peristalsis of rectum and distal sigmoid colon 1. Associated with Down syndrome

B. Due to congenital failure of ganglion cells (neural crest-derived) to descend into myenteric and submucosal plexus 1.

Myenteric (Auerbach) plexus is located between the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers of the muscularis propria and regulates motility.

2.

Submucosal (Meissner) plexus is located in the submucosa and regulates blood flow, secretions, and absorption.

C. Clinical features are based on obstruction.

1.

Failure to pass meconium 2.

3.

Massive dilatation (megacolon) of bowel proximal to obstruction with risk for rupture

D. Rectal suction biopsy reveals lack of ganglion cells.

Benign, with no malignant potential 2. Adenomatous polyps are due to neoplastic proliferation of glands (Fig. 10.25); 2nd most common type of colonic polyp i. Benign, but premalignant; may progress to adenocarcinoma via the adenoma-carcinoma sequence 3. Adenoma-carcinoma sequence describes the molecular progression from normal colonic mucosa to adenomatous polyp to carcinoma.

i. APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) mutations (sporadic or germline) increase risk for formation of polyp.

ii. K-ras mutation leads to formation of polyp.

iii. p53 mutation and increased expression of COX allow for progression to carcinoma; aspirin impedes progression from adenoma to carcinoma.

C. Screening for polyps is performed by colonoscopy and testing for fecal occult blood; polyps are usually clinically silent, but can bleed.

1. Goal is to remove adenomatous polyps before progression to carcinoma.

D. On colonoscopy, hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps look identical. Hence, all polyps are removed and examined microscopically.

1. Greatest risk for progression from adenoma to carcinoma is related to size > 2 cm, sessile growth, and villous histology.

VIII. FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS (FAP)

A. Autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 100s to 1000s of adenomatous colonic polyps (Fig. 10.26)

B. Due to inherited APC mutation (chromosome 5); increases propensity to develop adenomatous polyps throughout colon and rectum

C. Colon and rectum are removed prophylactically; otherwise, almost all patients develop carcinoma by 40 years of age.

D. Gardner syndrome is FAP with fibromatosis and osteomas.

1.

Fibromatosis is a non-neoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts; arises in retroperitoneum (desmoid) and locally destroys tissue 2.

Osteoma is a benign tumor of bone that usually arises in the skull.

E. Turcot syndrome is FAP with CNS tumors (medulloblastoma and glial tumors).

IX.

A. Sporadic, hamartomatous (benign) polyp that arises in children(< 5 years) 1. Usually presents as a solitary rectal polyp that prolapses and bleeds

B. Juvenile polyposis is characterized by multiple juvenile polyps in the stomach and colon; large numbers ofjuvenile polyps increase the risk of progression to carcinoma.

X.

A. Hamartomatous (benign) polyps throughout GI tract and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (freckle-like spots) on lips, oral mucosa, and genital skin; autosomal dominant disorder

B. Increased risk for colorectal, breast, and gynecologic cancer

XI. COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

A. Carcinoma arising from colonic or rectal mucosa; 3rd most common site of cancer and 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death 1. Peak incidence is 60-70 years of age.

B. Most commonly arises from adenoma-carcinoma sequence; a second important molecular pathway is microsatellite instability (MSI).

1.

Microsatellites are repeating sequences of noncoding DNA; integrity of sequence (stability) is maintained during cell division.

2.

Instability indicates defective DNA copy mechanisms (e.g., DNA mismatch repair enzymes).

3.

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) is due to inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair enzymes.

i. Increased risk for colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial carcinoma ii. Colorectal carcinoma arises de novo (not from adenomatous polyps) at a relatively early age; usually right-sided

C. Screening for colorectal carcinoma occurs via colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing; begins at 50 years of age 1. Goal is to remove adenomatous polyps before carcinoma develops and to detect cancer early (before clinical symptoms arise).

D. Carcinoma can develop anywhere along entire length of colon.

1.

Left-sided carcinoma usually grows as a 'napkin-ring' lesion; presents with decreased stool caliber, left lower quadrant pain, and blood-streaked stool 2.

Right-sided carcinoma usually grows as a raised lesion; presents with irondeficiency anemia (occult bleeding) and vague pain. An older adult with iron deficiency anemia has colorectal carcinoma until proven otherwise.

E. Colonic carcinoma is associated with an increased risk for Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.

F. Staging 1.

T-depth of invasion; tumors limited to the mucosa generally do not spread due to lack of lymphatics in the mucosa.

2.

N-spread to regional lymph nodes 3.

M-distant spread; most commonly involves the liver

G. CEA is a serum tumor marker that is useful for assessing treatment response and detecting recurrence; not useful for screening

Exocrine Pancreas, Gallbladder, and Liver Pathology

D. Bilirubin stones (pigmented) are composed ofbilirubin (Fig. 11.2B).

1.

2.

Risk factors include extravascular hemolysis (increased bilirubin in bile) and biliary tract infection (e.g., E coli, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Clonorchis sinensis).

i. Ascaris lumbricoides is a common roundworm that infects 25% of the world's population, especially in areas with poor sanitation (fecal-oral transmission); infects the biliary tract, increasing the risk for gallstones ii. Clonorchis sinensis is endemic in China, Korea, and Vietnam (Chinese liver fluke); infects the biliary tract, increasing the risk for gallstones, cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma

E. Gallstones are usually asymptomatic; complications include biliary colic, acute and chronic cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, gallstone ileus, and gallbladder cancer.

C. Arises with disturbances in bilirubin metabolism (Table 11.1)

D. Normal bilirubin metabolism 1.

RBCs are consumed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.

2.

Protoporphyrin (from heme) is converted to unconjugated bilirubin (UCB).

3.

Albumin carries UCB to the liver.

4.

Uridine glucuronyl transferase (UGT) in hepatocytes conjugates bilirubin.

5.

Conjugated bilirubin (CB) is transferred to bile canaliculi to form bile, which is stored in the gallbladder.

6.

Bile is released into the small bowel to aid in digestion.

7.

Intestinal flora convert CB to urobilinogen, which is oxidized to stercobilin (makes stool brown) and urobilin (partially reabsorbed into blood and filtered by kidney, making urine yellow).

HAV is commonly acquired by travelers. HEV is commonly acquired from contaminated water or undercooked seafood.

Parenteral transmission (e.g., childbirth, unprotected intercourse, intravenous drug abuse [IVDA], and needle stick)

Parenteral transmission (e.g., IVDA, unprotected intercourse); risk from transfusion is almost nonexistent due to screening of the blood supply.

Dark urine due to t urine urobilinogen (UCB is not water soluble and, thus, is absent from urine) Increased risk for pigmented bilirubin gallstones

UCB is fat soluble and can deposit in the basal ganglia (kernicterus) leading to neurological deficits and death. Treatment is phototherapy (makes UCB water soluble).

Jaundice during stress (e.g., severe infection); otherwise, not clinically significant

Liver is dark; otherwise, not clinically significant Rotor syndrome is similar to Dubin-Johnson syndrome, but lacks liver discoloration.

Dark urine (due to bilirubinuria) and pale stool Pruritus due to t plasma bile acids Hypercholesterolemia with xanthomas Steatorrhea with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins

Dark urine due to t urine bilirubin; urine urobilinogen is normal or decreased.

Acute hepatitis; no chronic state. Anti-virus IgM marks active infection. Antivirus IgG is protective, and its presence indicates prior infection or immunization (immunization is available for HAV). HEV infection in pregnant women is associated with fulminant hepatitis (liver failure with massive liver necrosis).

Results in acute hepatitis; chronic disease occurs in 20% of cases (Table 11.3).

Results in acute hepatitis; chronic disease occurs in most cases. HCV-RNA test confirms infection; decreased RNA levels indicate recovery; persistence indicates chronic disease.

III. POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA

A. Due to obstruction of urinary tract downstream from the kidney (e.g., ureters)

B. Decreased outflow results in ,I, GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.

D. With long-standing obstruction, tubular damage ensues, resulting in decreased reabsorption of BUN (serum BUN:Cr ratio < 15), decreased reabsorption of sodium (FEN a > 2%), and inability to concentrate urine (urine osm < 500 mOsm/kg).

IV. ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS

A. Injury and necrosis of tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 12.5); most common cause of acute renal failure (intrarenal azotemia)

B. Necrotic cells plug tubules; obstruction decreases GFR.

D. Etiology may be ischemic or nephrotoxic.

1. Ischemia-Decreased blood supply results in necrosis of tubules.

i. Often preceded by prerenal azotemia ii. Proximal tubule and medullary segment of the thick ascending limb are particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.

2. Nephrotoxic-Toxic agents result in necrosis of tubules.

i. Proximal tubule is particularly susceptible.

ii. Causes include aminoglycosides (most common), heavy metals (e.g., lead), myoglobinuria (e.g., from crush injury to muscle), ethylene glycol (associated with oxalate crystals in urine), radiocontrast dye, and urate (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome).

iii. Hydration and allopurinol are used prior to initiation of chemotherapy to decrease risk of urate-induced ATN.

2.

Fever, weight loss, or paraneoplastic syndrome (e.g., EPO, renin, PTHrP, or ACTH) may also be present.

3.

Rarely may present with left-sided varicocele i. Involvement of the left renal vein by carcinoma blocks drainage of the left spermatic vein leading to varicocele.

11. Right spermatic vein drains directly into the IVC; hence, right-sided varicocele is not seen.

C. Gross exam reveals a yellow mass (Fig. 12.19A); microscopically, the most common variant exhibits clear cytoplasm (clear cell type, Fig. 12.19B).

D. Pathogenesis involves loss of VHL (3p) tumor suppressor gene, which leads to increased IGF-1 (promotes growth) and increased HIF transcription factor (increases VEGF and PDGF).

E. Tumors may be hereditary or sporadic.

1.

Sporadic tumors classically arise in adult males (average age is 60 years) as a single tumor in the upper pole of the kidney; major risk factor for sporadic tumors is cigarette smoke.

2.

Hereditary tumors arise in younger adults and are often bilateral.

i. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with inactivation of the VHL gene leading to increased risk for hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum and renal cell carcinoma.

F. Staging 1.

T-based on size and involvement of the renal vein (occurs commonly and increases risk of hematogenous spread to the lungs and bone) 2.

N-spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes

C. Histologically, HPV-associated condylomas are characterized by koilocytes (hallmark ofHPV-infected cells, Fig. 13.lB).

D. Condylomas rarely progress to carcinoma (6 and 11 are low-risk HPV types).

IV.

A. Characterized by thinning of the epidermis and fibrosis (sclerosis) of the dermis

B. Presents as a white patch (leukoplakia) with parchment-like vulvar skin

C. Most commonly seen in postmenopausal women; possible autoimmune etiology

D. Benign, but associated with a slightly increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma

V.

A. Characterized by hyperplasia of the vulvar squamous epithelium

pathoma.com 1.

Risk factors are related to HPV exposure and include multiple partners and early first age of intercourse; generally occurs in women of reproductive age 2.

Arises from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a dysplastic precursor lesion characterized by koilocytic change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity

F. Non-HPV related vulvar carcinoma arises, most often, from long-standing lichen sclerosis.

1.

2.

Melanoma is PAS-, keratin-, and S-100+.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Canal leading to the cervix

B. Mucosa is lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium

II. ADENOSIS

A. Focal persistence of columnar epithelium in the upper vagina (Fig. 13.2B) 1. During development, squamous epithelium from the lower 1/3 of the vagina (derived from the urogenital sinus) grows upward to replace the columnar epithelium lining of the upper 2/3 of the vagina (derived from the Miillerian ducts).

B. Increased incidence in females who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero

Ill. CLEAR CELL ADENOCARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of glands with clear cytoplasm

B. Rare, but feared, complication of DES-associated vaginal adenosis

Fig. 13.1 Condyloma acuminata. A, Microscopic appearance. B, Koi iocytic change. Fig. 13.2A Extramammary Paget disease of the vulva. (Courtesy of webpathology.com)

C. Discovery of this complication (along with other DES-induced abnormalities of the gynecologic tract such as abnormal shape of the uterus) led to cessation of DES usage.

IV.

A. Malignant mesenchymal proliferation of immature skeletal muscle; rare

B. Presents as bleeding and a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina or penis of a child (usually< 5 yrs of age); also known as sarcoma botryoides (Fig. 13.3)

C. Rhabdomyoblast, the characteristic cell, exhibits cytoplasmic cross-striations and positive immunohistochemical staining for desmin and myogenin.

V.

A. Carcinoma arising from squamous epithelium lining the vaginal mucosa

B. Usually related to high-risk HPV

C. Precursor lesion is vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN).

D. When spread to regional lymph nodes occurs, cancer from the lower 1/3 ofvagina goes to inguinal nodes, and cancer from the upper 2/3 goes to regional iliac nodes.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Anatomically, comprises the "neck" of the uterus

B. Divided into the exocervix (visible on vaginal exam) and endocervix 1.

Exocervix is lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium.

2.

Endocervix is lined by a single layer of columnar cells.

3.

Junction between the exocervix and endocervix is called the transformation zone (Fig. 13.4A).

II. HPV

A. Sexually transmitted DNA virus that infects the lower genital tract, especially the cervix in the transformation zone

B. Infection is usually eradicated by acute inflammation; persistent infection leads to an increased risk for cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN).

C. Risk of CIN depends on HPV type, which is determined by DNA sequencing.

1.

High-risk-HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 33 2.

D. High-risk HPV produce E6 and E7 proteins which result in increased destruction of p53 and Rb, respectively. Loss of these tumor suppressor proteins increases the risk for CIN.

III. CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA

A. Characterized by koilocytic change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity within the cervical epithelium.

B. Divided into grades based on the extent of epithelial involvement by immature dysplastic cells 1.

CIN I involves < 1/3 of the thickness of the epithelium.

2.

CIN II involves < 2/3 of the thickness of the epithelium.

3.

CIN III involves slightly less than the entire thickness of the epithelium (Fig. 13.4B).

4.

Carcinoma in situ (CIS) involves the entire thickness of the epithelium.

C. CIN classically progresses in a stepwise fashion through CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and CIS to become invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

1.

Progression is not inevitable (e.g., CINI often regresses).

2.

The higher the grade of dysplasia, the more likely it is to progress to carcinoma and the less likely it is to regress to normal.

IV.

A. Invasive carcinoma that arises from the cervical epithelium

B. Most commonly seen in middle-aged women (average age is 40-50 years)

C. Presents as vaginal bleeding, especially postcoital bleeding, or cervical discharge

D. Key risk factor is high-risk HPV infection; secondary risk factors include smoking and immunodeficiency (e.g., cervical carcinoma is an AIDS-defining illness).

E. Most common subtypes of cervical carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (80% of cases) and adenocarcinoma (15% of cases). Both types are related to HPV infection.

F. Advanced tumors often invade through the anterior uterine wall into the bladder, blocking the ureters. Hydronephrosis with postrenal failure is a common cause of death in advanced cervical carcinoma.

V.

A. The goal of screening is to catch dysplasia (CIN) before it develops into carcinoma.

1.

Progression from CIN to carcinoma, on average, takes 10-20 years.

2.

Screening begins at age 21 and is initially performed every three years.

B. Pap smear is the gold standard for screening.

1.

Cells are scraped from the transformation zone using a brush and analyzed under a microscope.

2.

Dysplastic cells are classified as low grade (CIN I) or high grade (CIN II and III).

3.

High-grade dysplasia is characterized by cells with hyperchromatic (dark) nuclei and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios (Fig. 13.4C).

C. Pap smear is the most successful screening test developed to date.

Fig. 13.4 Cervix. A, Cervical transformation zone, normal. B, CIN Ill. C, High-grade dysplasia, Pap smear. (Courtesy of Ed Uthman, MD) 1.

It is responsible for a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of cervical carcinoma (cervical carcinoma went from being the most common to one of the least common types of gynecologic carcinoma in the US).

2.

Women who develop invasive cervical carcinoma usually have not undergone screening.

D. An abnormal Pap smear is followed by confirmatory colposcopy (visualization of cervix with a magnifying glass) and biopsy.

E. Limitations of the Pap smear include inadequate sampling of the transformation zone (false negative screening) and limited efficacy in screening for adenocarcinoma.

1. Despite Pap smear screening, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has not decreased significantly.

F. Immunization is effective in preventing HPV infections.

1.

The quadrivalent vaccine covers HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.

2.

Antibodies generated against types 6 and 11 protect against condylomas.

3.

Antibodies generated against types 16 and 18 protect against CIN and carcinoma.

4.

Pap smears are still necessary due to the limited number ofHPV types covered by the vaccine.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Endometrium is the mucosa I lining of the uterine cavity.

B. Myometrium is the smooth muscle wall underlying the endometrium (Fig. 13.5).

C. Endometrium is hormonally sensitive.

1.

Growth of the endometrium is estrogen driven (proliferative phase).

2.

Preparation of the endometrium for implantation is progesterone driven (secretory phase).

3.

Shedding occurs with loss of progesterone support (menstrual phase).

II. ASHERMAN SYNDROME

A. Secondary amenorrhea due to loss of the basalis and scarring

B. Result of overaggressive dilation and curettage (D&C)

III. ANOVULATORY CYCLE

A. Lack of ovulation

B. Results in an estrogen-driven proliferative phase without a subsequent progesteronedriven secretory phase 1. Proliferative glands break down and shed resulting in uterine bleeding.

Fig. 13.5 Endometrium overlying myometrium, Fig. 13.6 Endometrial polyp. normal.

2. Represents a common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, especially during menarche and menopause

IV.

A. Bacterial infection of the endometrium

B. Usually due to retained products of conception (e.g., after delivery or miscarriage); retained products act as a nidus for infection.

C. Presents as fever, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain

V.

A. Chronic inflammation of the endometrium

B. Characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells 1. Plasma cells are necessary for the diagnosis of chronic endometritis given that lymphocytes are normally found in the endometrium.

C. Causes include retained products of conception, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (e.g., Chlamydia), IUD, and TB.

D. Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and infertility

VI. ENDOMETRIAL POLYP

A. Hyperplastic protrusion of endometrium (Fig. 13.6)

B. Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding

C. Can arise as a side effect of tamoxifen, which has anti-estrogenic effects on the breast but weak pro-estrogenic effects on the endometrium

VII. ENDOMETRIOSIS

A. Endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine endometrial lining 1. Most likely due to retrograde menstruation with implantation at an ectopic site

B. Presents as dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and pelvic pain; may cause infertility 1. Endometriosis cycles just like normal endometrium.

C. Most common site of involvement is the ovary, which classically results in formation of a 'chocolate' cyst (Fig. 13.7A).

1.

Other sites of involvement include the uterine ligaments (pelvic pain), pouch of Douglas (pain with defecation), bladder wall (pain with urination), bowel serosa (abdominal pain and adhesions), and fallopian tube mucosa (scarring increases risk for ectopic tubal pregnancy); implants classically appear as yellow-brown 'gun-powder' nodules (Fig. 13.7B).

2.

Involvement of the uterine myometrium is called adenomyosis.

D. There is an increased risk of carcinoma at the site ofendometriosis, especially in the ovary.

VIII. ENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIA

A. Hyperplasia ofendometrial glands relative to stroma (Fig. 13.8)

B. Occurs as a consequence of unopposed estrogen (e.g., obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, and estrogen replacement)

C. Classically presents as postmenopausal uterine bleeding

D. Classified histologically based on architectural growth pattern (simple or complex) and the presence or absence of cellular atypia 1. Most important predictor for progression to carcinoma (major complication) is the presence of cellular atypia; simple hyperplasia with atypia often progresses to cancer (30%); whereas, complex hyperplasia without atypia rarely does (<5%).

IX.

A. Malignant proliferation of endometrial glands (Fig. 13.9A) 1. Most common invasive carcinoma of the female genital tract

B. Presents as postmenopausal bleeding

C. Arises via two distinct pathways: hyperplasia and sporadic

D. In the hyperplasia pathway (75% of cases), carcinoma arises from endometrial hyperplasia.

1.

Risk factors are related to estrogen exposure and include early menarche/late menopause, nulliparity, infertility with anovulatory cycles, and obesity.

2.

Average age ofpresentation is 60 years.

3.

Histology is endometrioid (i.e., normal endometrium-like, Fig. 13.9B).

E. In the sporadic pathway (25% of cases), carcinoma arises in an atrophic endometrium with no evident precursor lesion.

1.

Average age at presentation is 70 years.

2.

Histology is usually serous and is characterized by papillary structures (Fig. 13.9C) with psammoma body formation; p53 mutation is common, and the tumor exhibits aggressive behavior.

X.

A. Benign neoplastic proliferation of smooth muscle arising from myometrium; most common tumor in females

B. Related to estrogen exposure 1.

2.

3.

C. Gross exam shows multiple, well-defined, white, whorled masses that may distort the uterus and impinge on pelvic structures (Fig. 13.10).

D. Usually asymptomatic; when present, symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and a pelvic mass.

XI. LEIOMYOSARCOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of smooth muscle arising from the myometrium

B. Arises de novo; leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas.

C. Usually seen in postmenopausal women

D. Gross exam often shows a single lesion with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage; histological features include necrosis, mitotic activity, and cellular atypia.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. The functional unit of the ovary is the follicle.

B. A follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by granulosa and theca cells (Fig. 13.llA) 1.

LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen production.

2.

FSH stimulates granulosa cells to convert androgen to estradiol (drives the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle).

3.

Estradiol surge induces an LH surge, which leads to ovulation (marking the beginning of the secretory phase of the endometrial cycle).

C. After ovulation, the residual follicle becomes a corpus luteum (Fig. 13.llB), which primarily secretes progesterone (drives the secretory phase which prepares the endometrium for a possible pregnancy).

1. Hemorrhage into a corpus luteum can result in a hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst, especially during early pregnancy.

D. Degeneration of follicles results in follicular cysts. Small numbers of follicular cysts are common in women and have no clinical significance.

II. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN DISEASE (PCOD)

A. Multiple ovarian follicular cysts due to hormone imbalance 1. Affects roughly 5% of women of reproductive age

B. Characterized by increased LH and low FSH (LH:FSH > 2) 1.

Increased LH induces excess androgen production (from theca cells) resulting in hirsutism (excess hair in a male distribution).

2.

Androgen is converted to estrone in adipose tissue.

i. Estrone feedback decreases FSH resulting in cystic degeneration of follicles.

ii. High levels of circulating estrone increase risk for endometrial carcinoma.

C. Classic presentation is an obese young woman with infertility, oligomenorrhea, and hirsutism; some patients have insulin resistance and may develop type 2 diabetes mellitus 10-15 years later.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Ovary is composed of three cell types: surface epithelium, germ cells, and sex cordstroma.

B. Tumor can arise from any of these cell types or from metastases.

II. SURFACE EPITHELIAL TUMORS

A. Most common type of ovarian tumor (70% of cases)

B. Derived from coelomic epithelium that lines the ovary; coelomic epithelium embryologically produces the epithelial lining of the fallopian tube (serous cells), endometrium, and endocervix (mucinous cells).

C. The two most common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors are serous and mucinous; both are usually cystic.

1.

Serous tumors are full ofwatery fluid.

2.

Mucinous tumors are full of mucus-like fluid.

D. Mucinous and serous tumors can be benign, borderline, or malignant.

1.

Benign tumors (cystadenomas) are composed of a single cyst with a simple, flat lining (Fig. 13.12); most commonly arise in premenopausal women (30 -40 years old) 2.

Malignant tumors (cystadenocarcinomas) are composed of complex cysts with a thick, shaggy lining; most commonly arise in postmenopausal women (60-70 years old) 3.

Borderline tumors have features in between benign and malignant tumors.

i. Better prognosis than clearly malignant tumors, but still carry metastatic potential 4.

D. Classified as complete or partial (Table 12.2)

E. Treatment is suction curettage.

1. Subsequent p-hCG monitoring is important to ensure adequate mole removal and to screen for the development of choriocarcinoma.

1. Choriocarcinoma may arise as a complication of gestation (spontaneous abortion, normal pregnancy, or hydatidiform mole) or as a spontaneous germ cell tumor.

ii. Choriocarcinomas that arise from the gestational pathway respond well to chemotherapy; those that arise from the germ cell pathway do not.

i. Normal serum PSA increases with age due to BPH (2.5 ng/mL for ages 40-49 years vs. 7.5 ng/mL for ages 70-79 years) ii. PSA > 10 ng/mL is highly worrisome at any age.

iii. Decreased% free-PSA is suggestive of cancer (cancer makes bound PSA).

E. Prostatic biopsy is required to confirm the presence of carcinoma.

1.

Shows small, invasive glands with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 14.llB) 2.

Gleason grading system is based on architecture alone (and not nuclear atypia).

C. Biopsy is performed by fine needle aspiration (FNA).

II. FOLLICULAR ADENOMA

A. Benign proliferation of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule (Fig. 15.4)

Fig. 15.2 Multinodular goiter. (Courtesy of Jamie Fig. 15.3 Hashimoto thyroiditis. Fig. 15.4 Follicular adenoma. Steinmetz, MD)

B. Usually nonfunctional; less commonly, may secrete thyroid hormone

III. PAPILLARY CARCINOMA

A. Most common type of thyroid carcinoma (80% of cases)

B. Exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood is a major risk factor.

C. Comprised of papillae lined by cells with clear, 'Orphan Annie eye' nuclei and nuclear grooves (Fig. 15.5A); papillae are often associated with psammoma bodies (Fig. 15.5B).

D. Often spreads to cervical (neck) lymph nodes, but prognosis is excellent (10-year survival > 95%)

IV.

A. Malignant proliferation of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule with invasion through the capsule (Fig. 15.6) 1.

Invasion through the capsule helps distinguish follicular carcinoma from follicular adenoma.

2.

Entire capsule must be examined microscopically.

3.

FNA only examines cells and not the capsule; hence, a distinction between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma cannot be made by FNA.

B. Metastasis generally occurs hematogenously.

V.

A. Malignant proliferation of parafollicular C cells; comprises 5% of thyroid carcinomas 1.

C cells are neuroendocrine cells that secrete calcitonin.

2.

Calcitonin lowers serum calcium by increasing renal calcium excretion but is inactive at normal physiologic levels.

3.

High levels of calcitonin produced by tumor may lead to hypocalcemia.

4.

Calcitonin often deposits within the tumor as amyloid.

B. Biopsy reveals sheets of malignant cells in an amyloid stroma (Fig. 15.7).

C. Familial cases are often due to multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B, which are associated with mutations in the RET oncogene.

1.

MEN 2 results in medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid adenomas (2A) or ganglioneuromas of the oral mucosa (2B).

2.

Detection of the RET mutation warrants prophylactic thyroidectomy.

VI. ANAPLASTIC CARCINOMA

A. Undifferentiated malignant tumor of the thyroid (Fig. 15.8); usually seen in elderly

B. Often invades local structures, leading to dysphagia or respiratory compromise

C. Poor prognosis

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Chief cells regulate serum free (ionized) calcium via parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which 1.

Increases bone osteoclast activity, releasing calcium and phosphate 2.

Increases small bowel absorption of calcium and phosphate (indirectly by activating vitamin D) 3.

B. Increased serum ionized calcium levels provide negative feedback to decrease PTH secretion.

II. PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

A. Excess PTH due to a disorder of the parathyroid gland itself

B. Most common cause is parathyroid adenoma (>80% of cases); sporadic parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma are less common causes.

C. Parathyroid adenoma is a benign neoplasm, usually involving one gland.

1. Most often results in asymptomatic hypercalcemia; however, may present with consequences of increased PTH and hypercalcemia such as i. Nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate stones) ii. Nephrocalcinosis-metastatic calcification of renal tubules (Fig. 15.9), potentially leading to renal insufficiency and polyuria 111. CNS disturbances (e.g., depression and seizures) 1v. Constipation, peptic ulcer disease, and acute pancreatitis v. Osteitis fibrosa cystica-resorption of bone leading to fibrosis and cystic spaces (Fig. 15.10) 2.

Laboratory findings include t serum PTH, t serum calcium, J,. serum phosphate, t urinary cAMP, and t serum alkaline phosphatase.

3.

Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected gland.

III. SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

A. Excess production of PTH due to a disease process extrinsic to the parathyroid gland

B. Most common cause is chronic renal failure.

1.

Renal insufficiency leads to decreased phosphate excretion.

2.

t serum phosphate binds free calcium.

3.

J,. free calcium stimulates all four parathyroid glands.

4.

t PTH leads to bone resorption (contributing to renal osteodystrophy).

5.

Lab findings include t PTH, J,. serum calcium, t serum phosphate, and t alkaline phosphatase.

Fig. 15.7 Medullary carcinoma. Fig. 15.8 Ana plastic carcinoma. Fig. 15.9 Nephrocalcinosis.

IV. HYPOPARATHYROIDISM

A. LowPTH

B. Causes include autoimmune damage to the parathyroids, surgical excision, and DiGeorge syndrome

C. Presents with symptoms related to low serum calcium 1.

2.

Muscle spasms (tetany)-may be elicited with filling of a blood pressure cuff (Trousseau sign) or tapping on the facial nerve (Chvostek sign)

D. Labs reveal .,J, PTH levels and .,J, serum calcium.

E. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to end-organ resistance to PTH.

1.

Labs reveal hypocalcemia with t PTH levels.

2.

Autosomal dominant form is associated with short stature and short 4th and 5th digits.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Composed of clusters of cells termed islets of Langerhans (Fig. 15.11)

B. A single islet consists of multiple cell types, each producing one type of hormone.

C. Insulin is secreted by beta cells, which lie in the center of the islets.

1.

2.

Increased glucose uptake by tissues leads to increased glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, and lipogenesis.

D. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells; it opposes insulin in order to increase blood glucose levels (e.g., in states of fasting) via glycogenolysis and lipolysis.

A. Insulin deficiency leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia

B. Due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells by T lymphocytes 1.

Characterized by inflammation of islets 2.

Associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 3.

Autoantibodies against insulin are often present (sign of damage) and may be seen years before clinical disease develops.

C. Manifests in childhood with clinical features of insulin deficiency 1. High serum glucose-Lack of insulin leads to decreased glucose uptake by fat and skeletal muscle.

Fig. 15.10 Osteitis fibrosa cystica. Fig. 15.11 Islets of Langerhans. Fig. 15.12 Amyloid in islets, type II DM.

2.

Weight loss, low muscle mass, and polyphagia-Unopposed glucagon leads to gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipolysis, which further exacerbates hyperglycemia.

3.

Polyuria, polydipsia, and glycosuria-Hyperglycemia exceeds renal ability to resorb glucose; excess filtered glucose leads to osmotic diuresis.

4.

Treatment involves lifelong insulin.

D. Risk for diabetic ketoacidosis 1.

2.

Often arises with stress (e.g., infection); epinephrine stimulates glucagon secretion increasing lipolysis (along with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis).

i. Increased lipolysis leads to increased free fatty acids (FFAs).

ii. Liver converts FFAs to ketone bodies (~-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid).

3.

Results in hyperglycemia (> 300 mg/dL), anion gap metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia 4.

Presents with Kussmaul respirations, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, and fruity smelling breath (due to acetone) 5.

Treatment is fluids (corrects dehydration from polyuria), insulin, and replacement of electrolytes (e.g., potassium).

Ill. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS

A. End-organ insulin resistance leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia 1.

Most common type of diabetes (90% of cases); affects 5-10% of the US population 2.

Incidence is rising.

B. Arises in middle-aged, obese adults 1.

Obesity leads to decreased numbers of insulin receptors.

2.

Strong genetic predisposition exists.

C. Insulin levels are increased early in disease, but later, insulin deficiency develops due to beta cell exhaustion; histology reveals amyloid deposition in the islets (Fig. 15.12).

D. Clinical features include polyuria, polydipsia, and hyperglycemia, but disease is often clinically silent.

E. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucose levels (normal is 70-120 mg/dL).

1.

2.

3.

Glucose tolerance test with a serum glucose level > 200 mg/dL two hours after glucose loading

F. Treatment involves weight loss (diet and exercise) initially; may require drug therapy to counter insulin resistance (e.g., sulfonylureas or metformin) or exogenous insulin after exhaustion of beta cells

G. Risk for hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma 1.

High glucose (> 500 mg/dL) leads to life-threatening diuresis with hypotension and coma.

2.

Ketones are absent due to small amounts of circulating insulin.

IV. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF DIABETES

A. Nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG) ofvascular basement membranes 1. NEG oflarge-and medium-sized vessels leads to atherosclerosis and its resultant complications.

i. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among diabetics.

ii. Peripheral vascular disease in diabetics is the leading cause of non traumatic amputations.

2. NEG of small vessels (arterioles) leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis (Fig. 15.13A).

i. Involvement of renal arterioles leads to glomerulosclerosis, resulting in small, scarred kidneys with a granular surface (Fig. 15.13B).

ii. Preferential involvement of efferent arterioles leads to glomerular hyperfiltration injury with microalbuminuria that eventually progresses to nephrotic syndrome; characterized by Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules in glomeruli 3. NEG of hemoglobin produces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of glycemic control.

B. Osmotic damage 1.

Glucose freely enters into Schwann cells (which myelinate peripheral nerves), pericytes of retinal blood vessels, and the lens.

2.

Aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol, resulting in osmotic damage.

3.

Leads to peripheral neuropathy, impotence, blindness, and cataracts; diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world.

V. PANCREATIC ENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS

A. Tumors of islet cells; account for < 5% of pancreatic neoplasms.

1. Often a component of MEN 1 along with parathyroid hyperplasia and pituitary adenomas

B. Insulinomas present as episodic hypoglycemia with mental status changes that are relieved by administration of glucose.

1. Diagnosed by -l.-serum glucose levels (usually < 50 mg/dL), t insulin, and t C-peptide

C. Gastrinomas present as treatment-resistant peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); ulcers may be multiple and can extend into the jejunum.

D. Somatostatinomas present as achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin) and cholelithiasis with steatorrhea (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin).

E. VIPomas secrete excessive vasoactive intestinal peptide leading to watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Composed of three layers; each secretes predominantly one class of hormones.

1.

Glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone).

2.

Fasciculata produces glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol).

3.

Reticularis produces weak androgens (e.g., DHEA).

B. Cortical hormones are derived from cholesterol.

Fig. 15.13 Complications of diabetes. A, Hyaline arteriolosclerosis. B, Glomerul osclerosis.

1.

Sequential enzymatic modification produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens (Fig. 15.14).

2.

Each layer secretes distinct hormones based on enzymes present in that layer.

II. HYPERALDOSTERONISM

A. Excess aldosterone

B. Classically presents as HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis 1.

Aldosterone increases absorption of sodium and secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule and collecting duct.

2.

Increased sodium expands plasma volume leading to HTN.

C. Primary hyperaldosteronism is most commonly due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (60%, Fig. 15.15) or adrenal adenoma (40%, Conn syndrome, Fig. 15.16); adrenal carcinoma is rare.

1.

CT is useful to determine pathology 2.

Treatment for bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (e.g., spironolactone or eplerenone); adenoma and carcinoma are surgically resected.

D. Secondary hyperaldosteronism arises with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., renovascular hypertension or CHF).

Fig. 15.14 Steroidogenesis, adrenal cortex.

Fig. 15.15 Adrenal hyperplasia. Fig. 15.16 Adrena l adenoma.

E. Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism are distinguished by plasma renin and edema 1.

Primary is characterized by low renin and no edema (aldosterone escape).

2.

Secondary is characterized by high renin; edema is often present.

F. Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) leads to familial hyperaldosteron ism 1.

Aberrant expression of aldosterone synthase in the fasciculata due to genetic mutation; autosomal dominant 2.

Classically presents as child with HTN and hypokalemia; aldosterone is high and renin is low.

3.

Responds to dexamethasone; confirmed with genetic testing

G. Liddle syndrome mimics hyperaldosteronism.

1.

Decreased degradation of sodium channels in collecting tubules due to genetic mutation; autosomal dominant 2.

Presents as child with HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but with low aldosterone and low renin 3.

4.

Treatment is potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride or triamterene), which block tubular sodium channels; spironolactone is not effective.

H. Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME) also mimics hyperaldosteronism.

1.

11~-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (ll~-HSD2) deficiency allows cortisol to activate renal aldosterone receptors; autosomal recessive 2.

Presents as child with HTN, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but with low aldosterone and low renin 3.

4.

May also arise with licorice (glycyrrhetinic acid), which blocks ll~-HSD2

III. HYPERCORTISOLISM (CUSHING SYNDROME)

A. Excess cortisol

B. Clinical features include 1.

Muscle weakness with thin extremities-Cortisol breaks down muscle to produce amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

2.

Moon facies, buffalo hump, and truncal obesity-High insulin (due to high glucose) increases storage of fat centrally.

3.

Abdominal striae-Impaired collagen synthesis results in thinning of skin 4.

HTN often with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis 1. High cortisol increases sensitivity of peripheral vessels to catecholamines.

ii. At very high levels, cortisol cross-reacts with mineralocorticoid receptors (aldosterone is not increased).

5.

6.

C. Diagnosis is based on 24-hour urine cortisol level (increased), late night salivary cortisol level (increased), and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.

1. Low-dose dexamethasone suppresses cortisol in normal individuals but fails to suppress cortisol in all causes of Cushing syndrome.

D. Plasma ACTH distinguishes ACTH-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome from ACTH-independent causes (table 15.1).

1.

IfACTH-independent, next step is CT to look for an adrenal lesion.

2.

IfACTH-dependent, next step is high-dose dexamethasone test.

E. High-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH production by a pituitary adenoma (serum cortisol is lowered) but does not suppress ectopic ACTH production (serum cortisol remains high).

F. Treatment generally involves surgical resection 1. Ketoconazole or metyrapone useful if surgery is not an option

IV. CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

A. Due to enzymatic defects in cortisol production; autosomal recessive 1.

High ACTH (decreased negative feedback) leads to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

2.

Mineralocorticoids and androgens may be increased or decreased depending on the enzyme defect.

B. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause (90% of cases).

1.

Aldosterone and cortisol are decreased; steroidogenesis is shunted towards androgens.

2.

Classic form presents in neonates as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia with lifethreatening hypotension (salt-wasting type); females have clitoral enlargement (genital ambiguity).

3.

Nonclassic form presents later in life with androgen excess leading to precocious puberty (males) or hirsutism with menstrual irregularities (females).

C. 11-hydroxylase deficiency also leads to androgen excess, but weak mineralocorticoids (DOC) are increased.

1.

Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) leads to HTN (sodium retention) with mild hypokalemia; renin and aldosterone are low.

2.

Clitoral enlargement is seen in females

D. 17-hydroxylase deficiency leads to decreased cortisol and androgens.

1.

Weak mineralocorticoids (DOC) are increased leading to HTN with mild hypokalemia; renin and aldosterone are low.

2.

Decreased androgens lead to primary amenorrhea and lack of pubic hair (females) or ambiguous genitalia with undescended testes (males).

E. Newborn screening for CAH via serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is routine 1.

2.

F. Treatment for CAH is glucocorticoids; mineralocorticoids (21-hydroxylase deficiency) or sex steroids (17-hydroxylase deficiency) given as necessary.

V. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

A. Deficiency of adrenal hormones

B. Acute insufficiency presents as weakness and shock. Causes include 1.

Abrupt withdrawal of glucocorticoids 2.

Treatment of Cushing syndrome 3.

Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome-hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands (Fig. 15.17), classically due to sepsis and DIC in young children with Neisseria meningitidis infection

C. Chronic insufficiency (Addison disease) presents with vague, progressive symptoms such as hypotension, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

D. Addison disease most often arises with progressive adrenal damage.

1.

Common causes include autoimmune destruction (most common cause in the West), TB (most common cause in the developing world), and metastatic carcinoma (e.g., from lung).

2.

Autoimmune adrenalitis can be a component of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes

E. Addison disease may also arise with pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disease.

1.

Hyperpigmentation (high ACTH) and hyperkalemia (low aldosterone) suggest primary adrenal insufficiency; secondary/tertiary insufficiency has no hyperpigmentation (low ACTH) and normal potassium (normal aldosterone).

2.

Lack of ACTH response with metyrapone stimulation test supports a secondary or tertiary cause.

3.

ACTH response with CRH stimulation test suggests hypothalamic (tertiary) disease.

F. Treatment is glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.

F. Associated with MEN 2A and 2B (RET), von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1

I. BREAST

A. Modified sweat gland embryologically derived from the skin 1. Breast tissue can develop anywhere along the milk line, which runs from the axilla to the vulva (e.g., supernumerary nipples).

B. The terminal duct lobular unit is the functional unit of the breast (Fig. 16.1); lobules make milk that drains via ducts to the nipple.

C. Lobules and ducts are lined by two layers of epithelium.

1.

Luminal cell layer-inner cell layer lining the ducts and lobules; responsible for milk production in the lobules 2.

Myoepithelial cell layer-outer cell layer lining ducts and lobules; contractile function propels milk towards the nipple.

D. Breast tissue is hormone sensitive.

1.

Before puberty, male and female breast tissue primarily consists oflarge ducts under the nipple.

2.

Development after menarche is primarily driven by estrogen and progesterone; lobules and small ducts form and are present in highest density in the upper outer quadrant.

3.

Breast tenderness during the menstrual cycle is a common complaint, especially prior to menstruation.

4.

During pregnancy, breast lobules undergo hyperplasia.

i. Hyperplasia is driven by estrogen and progesterone produced by the corpus luteum (early first trimester), fetus, and placenta (later in pregnancy) 5.

After menopause, breast tissue undergoes atrophy.

E. Galactorrhea refers to milk production outside oflactation.

1.

It is not a symptom of breast cancer.

2.

Causes include nipple stimulation (common physiologic cause), prolactinoma of the anterior pituitary (common pathologic cause), and drugs.

I. ACUTE MASTITIS

A. Bacterial infection of the breast, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus

B. Associated with breast-feeding; fissures develop in the nipple providing a route of entry for microbes.

C. Presents as an erythematous breast with purulent nipple discharge; may progress to abscess formation

D. Treatment involves continued drainage (e.g., feeding) and antibiotics (e.g., dicloxacillin).

II. PERIDUCTAL MASTITIS

B. Usually seen in smokers pathoma.com 1. Relative vitamin A deficiency results in squamous metaplasia oflactiferous ducts, producing duct blockage and inflammation.

C. Clinically presents as a subareolar mass with nipple retraction

III. MAMMARY DUCT ECTASIA

A. Inflammation with dilation (ectasia) of the subareolar ducts 1. Rare; classically arises in multiparous postmenopausal women

1.

Papillary carcinoma is characterized by fibrovascular projections lined by epithelial cells without underlying myoepithelial cells.

2.

Risk of papillary carcinoma increases with age; thus, it is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women.

III. FIBROADENOMA

A. Tumor of fibrous tissue and glands (Fig. 16.3)

B. Most common benign neoplasm of the breast; usually seen in premenopausal women

C. Presents as a well-circumscribed, mobile marble-like mass

2.

Age-Cancer usually arises in postmenopausal women, with the notable exception of hereditary breast cancer.

3.

4.

5.

6.

First-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer

II. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS)

A. Malignant proliferation of cells in ducts with no invasion of the basement membrane

B. Often detected as calcification on mammography; DCIS does not usually produce a mass.

1. Mammographic calcifications can also be associated with benign conditions such as fibrocystic changes (especially sclerosing adenosis) and fat necrosis.

Fig. 16.4 Phyllodes tumor. Fig. 16.5 Ductal carcinoma in situ, comedo type.

2. Biopsy of calcifications is often necessary to distinguish between benign and malignant conditions.

C. Histologic subtypes are based on architecture; comedo type is characterized by high-grade cells with necrosis and dystrophic calcification in the center of ducts (Fig. 16.5).

D. Paget disease of the breast is DCIS that extends up the ducts to involve the skin of the nipple (Fig. 16.6).

1.

Presents as nipple ulceration and erythema 2.

Paget disease of the breast is almost always associated with an underlying carcinoma.

III. INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA

A. Invasive carcinoma that classically forms duct-like structures

B. Most common type of invasive carcinoma in the breast, accounting for > 80% of cases

C. Presents as a mass detected by physical exam or by mammography 1.

Clinically detected masses are usually 2 cm or greater.

2.

Mammographically detected masses are usually 1 cm or greater.

3.

Advanced tumors may result in dimpling of the skin or retraction of the nipple.

Inflammatory carcinoma-characterized by carcinoma in dermal lymphatics (Fig. 16.8) i. Presents classically as an inflamed, swollen breast (tumor cells block drainage of lymphatics) with no discrete mass; can be mistaken for acute mastitis ii. Poor prognosis

IV.

A. Malignant proliferation of cells in lobules with no invasion of the basement membrane

B. LCIS does not produce a mass or calcifications and is usually discovered incidentally on biopsy.

C. Characterized by dyscohesive cells lacking E-cadherin adhesion protein

D. Often multifocal and bilateral

E. Treatment is tamoxifen (to reduce the risk of subsequent carcinoma) and close follow-up; low risk of progression to invasive carcinoma

V.

A. Invasive carcinoma that characteristically grows in a single-file pattern (Fig. 16.9); cells may exhibit signet-ring morphology.

1. No duct formation due to lack ofE-cadherin.

VI. PROGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE FACTORS

A. Prognosis in breast cancer is based on TNM staging.

1.

Metastasis is the most important factor, but most patients present before metastasis occurs.

2.

Spread to axillary lymph nodes is the most useful prognostic factor (given that metastasis is not common at presentation); sentinel lymph node biopsy is used to assess axillary lymph nodes.

B. Predictive factors predict response to treatment.

1. Most important factors are estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu gene amplification (overexpression) status.

Fig. 16.8 Inflammatory carcinoma. A, Microscopic appearance. B, Clinical appearance. (8, Courtesy of Fig. 16.9 Invasive lobular carcinoma. Jerome Taxy, MD) 2.

Presence of ER and PR is associated with response to antiestrogenic agents (e.g., tamoxifen); both receptors are located in the nucleus (Fig. 16.10).

3.

HER2/neu amplification is associated with response to trastuzumab (Herceptin), a designer antibody directed against the HER2 receptor; HER2/neu is a growth factor receptor present on the cell surface (Fig. 16.11).

4.

'Triple-negative' tumors are negative for ER, PR, and HER2/neu and have a poor prognosis; African American women have an increased propensity to develop triple-negative carcinoma.

VII. HEREDITARY BREAST CANCER

A. Represents 10% of breast cancer cases

B. Clinical features that suggest hereditary breast cancer include multiple first-degree relatives with breast cancer, tumor at an early age (premenopausal), and multiple tumors in a single patient.

C. BRCAl and BRCA2 mutations are the most important single gene mutations associated with hereditary breast cancer.

1.

BRCAl mutation is associated with breast and ovarian carcinoma.

2.

BRCA2 mutation is associated with breast carcinoma in males.

D. Women with a genetic propensity to develop breast cancer may choose to undergo removal of both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) to decrease the risk of developing carcinoma.
