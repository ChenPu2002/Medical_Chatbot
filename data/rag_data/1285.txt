immunocompromised individuals	have a	weakened immune system
weakened immune system	increases	susceptibility to infections
susceptibility to infections	is a	risk factor for tuberculosis
tuberculosis	may require	long-term treatment

effective antibiotics	are essential for	successful treatment
successful treatment	improves	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	are measured by	survival rates
survival rates	can be used for	mortality prediction
mortality prediction	aids in	healthcare planning
healthcare planning	involves	resource allocation
resource allocation	ensures	availability of necessary healthcare services
necessary healthcare services	include	diagnostic tests
diagnostic tests	help in	early detection
early detection	leads to	timely treatment
timely treatment	improves	prognosis
prognosis	is a	prediction of the disease outcome
disease outcome	is influenced by	various factors
various factors	include	age and comorbidities
age and comorbidities	affect	disease severity
disease severity	influences	treatment response
treatment response	is monitored through	follow-up visits
follow-up visits	assess	treatment effectiveness
