gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	is a type of	infection
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can cause	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	may lead to	scarring of the seminal vesicles
scarring	can result in	obstructed seminal vesicles
obstructed seminal vesicles	can cause	infertility
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	is caused by	Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria
Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria	can be transmitted through	sexual contact
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	can eliminate	the bacteria
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can recur	if untreated
recurrent gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	may require	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	can involve	removing the affected seminal vesicles
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	is commonly associated with	urethritis
urethritis	can cause	painful urination
painful urination	can be relieved by	medication
medication	can include	pain relievers
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can lead to	epididymitis
epididymitis	is inflammation of	the epididymis
the epididymis	is a part of	the male reproductive system
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	is more common in	sexually active males
sexually active males	are at risk for	gonorrhea
gonorrhea	is a	sexually transmitted infection
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	may be diagnosed with	a physical examination
a physical examination	can reveal	tenderness in the genital area
tenderness in the genital area	may indicate	gonococcal seminal vesiculitis
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can lead to	complications
complications	can include	abscess formation
abscess formation	may require	drainage
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be prevented by	practicing safe sex
practicing safe sex	involves	using barrier methods
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be asymptomatic	in some cases
asymptomatic gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can still	be transmitted
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	may be associated with	other STIs
other STIs	can contribute to	the inflammation and infection
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can cause	discomfort during sexual intercourse
discomfort during sexual intercourse	may be a	symptom of the condition
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be diagnosed through	laboratory testing
laboratory testing	can detect	the presence of the bacteria
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	may require	long-term antibiotic treatment
long-term antibiotic treatment	is necessary to	fully eradicate the infection
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can lead to	chronic pelvic pain
chronic pelvic pain	can significantly impact	quality of life
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be associated with	urethral discharge
urethral discharge	is a	common symptom
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can increase the risk of	spreading the infection to partners
spreading the infection to partners	can lead to	complications in females
complications in females	can include	pelvic inflammatory disease
pelvic inflammatory disease	can cause	infertility
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be a	recurrent condition
recurrent gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	may require	ongoing treatment
ongoing treatment	can involve	regular follow-up appointments
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be associated with	prostatitis
prostatitis	is inflammation of	the prostate gland
the prostate gland	plays a role in	reproductive and urinary function
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be a	sexually transmitted infection
sexually transmitted infections	can be transmitted through	various sexual activities
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be diagnosed through	imaging tests
imaging tests	can show	abnormalities in the seminal vesicles
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can be caused by	unprotected sexual intercourse
unprotected sexual intercourse	increases the risk of	contracting the infection
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can affect	sexual function
sexual function	can be impacted by	the inflammation and scarring
gonococcal seminal vesiculitis	can lead to	decreased sperm count
