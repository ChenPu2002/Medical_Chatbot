gonococcal infection	is a	bacterial infection
gonococcal infection	can cause	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	can lead to	scarring
scarring	can cause	obstructed urinary flow
obstructed urinary flow	may result in	urinary tract infection
urinary tract infection	can lead to	fever
fever	can cause	dehydration
dehydration	can lead to	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	may result in	cardiac arrhythmia
cardiac arrhythmia	can cause	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	can lead to	death
gonococcal infection	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	can cause	gastrointestinal upset
gastrointestinal upset	can result in	nausea
nausea	can cause	decreased appetite
decreased appetite	may lead to	weight loss
weight loss	can result in	malnutrition
malnutrition	can cause	weakened immune system
weakened immune system	may result in	increased susceptibility to infection
increased susceptibility to infection	can lead to	recurrent gonococcal infection
recurrent gonococcal infection	can cause	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	can result in	scarring
scarring	can cause	obstruction of the urinary tract
obstruction of the urinary tract	may lead to	urinary tract infection
urinary tract infection	can cause	fever
fever	can result in	dehydration
dehydration	may cause	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	can lead to	cardiac arrhythmia
cardiac arrhythmia	can cause	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	can result in	death
gonococcal infection	can be prevented by	practicing safe sex
practicing safe sex	can reduce the risk of	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	is transmitted through	sexual contact
sexual contact	can result in	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	is more common in	sexually active individuals
sexually active individuals	are at higher risk of	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can lead to	complications in pregnancy
complications in pregnancy	can result in	preterm birth
preterm birth	can cause	neonatal complications
neonatal complications	can lead to	long-term health issues
gonococcal infection	is diagnosed through	laboratory testing
laboratory testing	can detect	the presence of gonococcal bacteria
gonococcal bacteria	can be	resistant to antibiotics
antibiotic resistance	can make	treatment more difficult
gonococcal infection	can be	asymptomatic
asymptomatic gonococcal infection	can still be	transmitted to others
transmission to others	can lead to	further spread of the infection
gonococcal infection	can be	recurrent
recurrent gonococcal infection	may be due to	incomplete treatment
incomplete treatment	can result in	antibiotic resistance
antibiotic resistance	can make	future infections harder to treat
gonococcal infection	can cause	infertility
infertility	can result in	difficulty conceiving
difficulty conceiving	may require	fertility treatments
fertility treatments	can be	expensive
gonococcal infection	is more common in	young adults
young adults	are at higher risk of	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	transmitted through childbirth
childbirth	can result in	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	transmitted through breastfeeding
breastfeeding	can result in	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	spread through contaminated objects
contaminated objects	can transmit	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	transmitted through oral sex
oral sex	can result in	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	is more common in	men who have sex with men
men who have sex with men	are at higher risk of	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	transmitted through anal sex
anal sex	can result in	gonococcal infection
gonococcal infection	can be	transmitted through vaginal sex
vaginal sex	can result in	gonococcal infection
