patience	is important for	the healing process
healing process	involves	tissue regeneration
tissue regeneration	is facilitated by	cell division
cell division	is a	biological process
biological processes	are influenced by	genetic factors
genetic factors	contribute to	disease susceptibility
disease susceptibility	varies among	individuals
individuals	have	different immune responses
immune responses	can be	compromised
compromised immune system	increases	infection risk
infection risk	is higher in	crowded environments
crowded environments	can facilitate	disease transmission
disease transmission	can be	airborne
airborne transmission	is common for	respiratory viruses

improved outcomes	enhance	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	is an	important goal
important goals	drive	healthcare policies
healthcare policies	are established by	governments
governments	enforce	regulations
regulations	ensure	patient safety
patient safety	is a	top priority
top priorities	require	continuous monitoring
continuous monitoring	helps in	identifying risks
identifying risks	allows for	preventive interventions
preventive interventions	can reduce	disease burden
disease burden	affects	public health
public health	focuses on	population well-being
population well-being	is influenced by	social determinants
social determinants	include	economic factors
economic factors	impact	healthcare accessibility
healthcare accessibility	affects	healthcare equity
healthcare equity	is a	major concern
major concerns	necessitate	health policies
health policies	aim to	address disparities
