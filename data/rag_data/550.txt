postmeasles encephalitis	is a type of	encephalitis
postmeasles encephalitis	can occur after	measles infection
postmeasles encephalitis	may lead to	neurological complications
neurological complications	can include	seizures
seizures	can be treated with	antiepileptic drugs
antiepileptic drugs	help control	seizures
postmeasles encephalitis	requires	supportive care
supportive care	involves	hydration and rest
postmeasles encephalitis	can lead to	long-term neurological deficits
long-term neurological deficits	may require	rehabilitation therapy
rehabilitation therapy	helps improve	motor function
postmeasles encephalitis	has a	low mortality rate
postmeasles encephalitis	is diagnosed through	clinical evaluation and imaging tests
clinical evaluation and imaging tests	aid in	identifying brain inflammation
postmeasles encephalitis	is preventable through	vaccination
vaccination	protects against	measles infection
postmeasles encephalitis	is more common in	young children
young children	are at higher risk of	complications from measles infection
postmeasles encephalitis	requires	hospitalization
hospitalization	ensures	close monitoring and medical intervention
postmeasles encephalitis	can cause	cognitive impairment
cognitive impairment	affects	memory and learning abilities
postmeasles encephalitis	has a	variable prognosis
postmeasles encephalitis	is managed by	a multidisciplinary team
multidisciplinary team	consists of	neurologists	infectious disease specialists	and rehabilitation therapists
postmeasles encephalitis	can result in	permanent brain damage
permanent brain damage	may lead to	lifelong disabilities
postmeasles encephalitis	may require	antiviral treatment
antiviral treatment	aims to	reduce viral replication
postmeasles encephalitis	can be associated with	inflammation of the brain
inflammation of the brain	can cause	severe symptoms
severe symptoms	require	intensive medical care
postmeasles encephalitis	is a	rare complication of measles
postmeasles encephalitis	can be diagnosed with	cerebrospinal fluid analysis
cerebrospinal fluid analysis	helps identify	viral infection
postmeasles encephalitis	can result in	neurological deficits
neurological deficits	may include	motor and speech impairments
postmeasles encephalitis	may necessitate	long-term follow-up care
long-term follow-up care	involves	monitoring and managing neurological symptoms
postmeasles encephalitis	is associated with	brain inflammation
brain inflammation	can cause	increased intracranial pressure
increased intracranial pressure	requires	urgent medical intervention
postmeasles encephalitis	is more common in	unvaccinated individuals
unvaccinated individuals	are at higher risk of	developing measles and its complications
postmeasles encephalitis	may be treated with	intravenous immunoglobulin therapy
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy	helps modulate	the immune response
postmeasles encephalitis	can result in	seizures and coma
seizures and coma	require	immediate medical attention
postmeasles encephalitis	may cause	permanent neurological damage
permanent neurological damage	can lead to	lifelong disabilities
postmeasles encephalitis	is a	potentially life-threatening condition
postmeasles encephalitis	can affect	individuals of all ages
postmeasles encephalitis	requires	specialized medical care
specialized medical care	is provided by	neurologists and infectious disease specialists
postmeasles encephalitis	can be associated with	viral persistence in the brain
viral persistence in the brain	contributes to	ongoing inflammation and damage
postmeasles encephalitis	may necessitate	neurocognitive rehabilitation
neurocognitive rehabilitation	focuses on	improving cognitive abilities
postmeasles encephalitis	can result in	behavioral changes
behavioral changes	require	psychological and behavioral interventions
postmeasles encephalitis	can lead to	long-term disability
long-term disability	may require	assistive devices and accommodations
postmeasles encephalitis	is a	neurological emergency
postmeasles encephalitis	can be prevented through	timely measles vaccination
timely measles vaccination	reduces	the risk of complications
postmeasles encephalitis	may manifest as	altered consciousness
altered consciousness	indicates	brain involvement
postmeasles encephalitis	can lead to	persistent neurological deficits
persistent neurological deficits	may affect	daily functioning
postmeasles encephalitis	may necessitate	anticonvulsant medication
anticonvulsant medication	helps control	seizures
postmeasles encephalitis	can result in	encephalopathy
encephalopathy	is a	generalized brain dysfunction
postmeasles encephalitis	can be associated with	viral encephalitis
