acute paralytic poliomyelitis	is a	medical condition
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	is caused by	poliovirus type ii
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	may result in	respiratory failure
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	can be prevented by	polio vaccine
polio vaccine	is a	preventive measure
polio vaccine	is administered through	injection
respiratory failure	can lead to	death
poliovirus type ii	belongs to	enterovirus family
enterovirus family	includes	coxsackievirus
coxsackievirus	can cause	hand	foot	and mouth disease
hand	foot	and mouth disease	is a	viral infection
hand	foot	and mouth disease	primarily affects	children
viral infection	can be treated with	antiviral medication
antiviral medication	inhibits	viral replication
poliovirus type ii	can be detected using	reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction	is a	laboratory technique
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction	is used for	viral detection
poliovirus type ii	is classified as	a neurotropic virus
poliovirus type ii	can cause	paralysis
paralysis	may affect	limbs
paralysis	may result in	muscle atrophy
muscle atrophy	leads to	loss of muscle strength
loss of muscle strength	affects	mobility
mobility	can be improved with	physical therapy
physical therapy	helps in	muscle strengthening
muscle strengthening	prevents	muscle wasting
muscle wasting	is a	degenerative process
degenerative process	occurs due to	nerve damage
nerve damage	is associated with	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	can lead to	lifelong disability
lifelong disability	requires	long-term care
long-term care	includes	supportive measures
supportive measures	aim to	improve quality of life
improve quality of life	is a	primary goal of care
care	is provided by	healthcare professionals
healthcare professionals	may include	doctors
doctors	specialize in	infectious diseases
infectious diseases	involve	pathogen transmission
pathogen transmission	can be prevented through	hand hygiene
hand hygiene	reduces	infection risk
infection risk	is higher in	crowded areas
crowded areas	facilitate	disease spread
disease spread	can be controlled by	quarantine measures
quarantine measures	restrict	movement
movement	can be limited by	physical impairment
physical impairment	is common in	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	is characterized by	muscle weakness
muscle weakness	affects	voluntary movements
voluntary movements	are controlled by	the central nervous system
the central nervous system	includes	the brain and spinal cord
brain and spinal cord	coordinate	bodily functions
bodily functions	can be impaired by	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	can be diagnosed with	clinical examination
clinical examination	involves	physical assessment
physical assessment	includes	muscle strength testing
muscle strength testing	evaluates	muscle function
muscle function	relies on	nerve signals
nerve signals	are disrupted in	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	ensures	medical care
medical care	is provided by	healthcare facilities
healthcare facilities	include	hospitals
hospitals	have	specialized units
specialized units	cater to	different medical needs
different medical needs	require	specific interventions
specific interventions	are determined by	healthcare professionals
healthcare professionals	follow	evidence-based guidelines
evidence-based guidelines	are developed through	research
research	contributes to	medical advancements
medical advancements	improve	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	are influenced by	early intervention
early intervention	is crucial for	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	is a	notifiable disease
notifiable disease	must be reported to	public health authorities
public health authorities	monitor	disease outbreaks
disease outbreaks	require	prompt containment
prompt containment	reduces	transmission rate
transmission rate	can be lowered by	vaccination programs
vaccination programs	target	at-risk populations
at-risk populations	include	infants and young children
infants and young children	are more susceptible to	acute paralytic poliomyelitis
acute paralytic poliomyelitis	is associated with	high morbidity
high morbidity	is a	public health concern
public health concern	necessitates	public awareness campaigns
public awareness campaigns	educate	the general population
the general population	can contribute to	disease prevention
disease prevention	is a	key aspect of healthcare
healthcare	aims to	promote well-being
promote well-being	includes	preventive measures
preventive measures	can save	lives
