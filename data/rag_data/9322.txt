heart block	is a condition associated with	syphilitic endocarditis
syphilitic endocarditis	can lead to	pericarditis
pericarditis	is an inflammation of	the pericardium
the pericardium	can be affected by	syphilitic endocarditis
syphilitic endocarditis	is a rare condition
rare conditions	like syphilitic endocarditis	require specialized treatment
syphilitic endocarditis	can result in	valvular calcifications
valvular calcifications	are a possible consequence of	syphilitic endocarditis
syphilitic endocarditis	can cause	heart valve thickening
heart valve thickening	is a characteristic of	syphilitic endocarditis
syphilitic endocarditis	can lead to	heart valve scarring
heart valve scarring	is a complication of	syphilitic endocarditis
