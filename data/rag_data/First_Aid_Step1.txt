“Biochemistry is the study of carbon compounds that crawl.” “We think we have found the basic mechanism by which life comes from life.” —Francis H. C. Crick “The biochemistry and biophysics are the notes required for life; they conspire, collectively, to generate the real unit of life, the organism.”

This high-yield material includes molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, and principles of metabolism (especially vitamins, cofactors, minerals, and single-enzyme-deficiency diseases). When studying metabolic pathways, emphasize important regulatory steps and enzyme deficiencies that result in disease, as well as reactions targeted by pharmacologic interventions. For example, understanding the defect in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its clinical consequences is higher yield than memorizing every intermediate in the purine salvage pathway.

Do not spend time learning details of organic chemistry, mechanisms, or physical chemistry. Detailed chemical structures are infrequently tested; however, many structures have been included here to help students learn reactions and the important enzymes involved. Familiarity with the biochemical techniques that have medical relevance—such as ELISA, immunoelectrophoresis, Southern blotting, and PCR—is useful. Review the related biochemistry when studying pharmacology or genetic diseases as a way to reinforce and integrate the material.

H1 histone (linker) Supercoiled structure Heterochromatin Euchromatin Metaphase chromosome Nucleosome (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) 2 DNA DNA double-helix

DNA exists in the condensed, chromatin form to fit into the nucleus. DNA loops twice around a histone octamer to form a nucleosome (“beads on a string”). H1 binds to the nucleosome and to “linker DNA,” thereby stabilizing the chromatin fiber.

Phosphate groups give DNA a ⊝ charge. Lysine and arginine give histones a ⊕ charge.

In mitosis, DNA condenses to form chromosomes. DNA and histone synthesis occurs during S phase.

Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is circular and does not utilize histones.

Heterochromatin Condensed, appears darker on EM (labeled H HeteroChromatin = Highly Condensed. in A ; Nu, nucleolus). Sterically inaccessible, Barr bodies (inactive X chromosomes) may be thus transcriptionally inactive. • methylation, visible on the periphery of nucleus.

DNA replication Eukaryotic DNA replication is more complex than in prokaryotes but uses many enzymes analogous to those listed below. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, DNA replication is semiconservative, involves continuous and discontinuous (Okazaki fragment) synthesis, and occurs in the 5′  3′ direction.

Mutations in DNA Severity of damage: silent << missense < nonsense < frameshift. Types of single nucleotide (point) mutations: • Transition—purine to purine (eg, A to G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (eg, C to T).

Transversion—purine to pyrimidine (eg, A to T) or pyrimidine to purine (eg, C to G). Single nucleotide substitutions

Silent mutation Nucleotide substitution codes for same (synonymous) amino acid; often base change in 3rd position of codon (tRNA wobble).

Missense mutation Nucleotide substitution results in changed amino acid (called conservative if new amino acid has similar chemical structure). Examples include sickle cell disease (substitution of glutamic acid with valine).

Nonsense mutation Nucleotide substitution results in early stop codon (UGA, UAA, UAG). Usually results in nonfunctional protein. Stop the nonsense! Other mutations

Frameshift mutation Deletion or insertion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 • misreading of all nucleotides downstream. Protein may be shorter or longer, and its function may be disrupted or altered. Examples include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease.

Splice site mutation Retained intron in mRNA • protein with impaired or altered function. Examples include rare causes of cancers, dementia, epilepsy, some types of β-thalassemia, Gaucher disease, Marfan syndrome.

Regulation of gene expression

Silencer DNA locus where regulatory proteins (“repressors”) bind, decreasing expression of a gene on the same chromosome.

Initial transcript is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). hnRNA is then modified and becomes mRNA.

The following processes occur in the nucleus:

Capping of 5′ end (addition of 7-methylguanosine cap)

Polyadenylation of 3′ end (≈ 200 As)

Splicing out of introns

Capped, tailed, and spliced transcript is called mRNA.

mRNA is transported out of nucleus to be translated in cytosol.

mRNA quality control occurs at cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), which contain exonucleases, decapping enzymes, and microRNAs; mRNAs may be degraded or stored in P-bodies for future translation.

Poly-A polymerase does not require a template. AAUAAA = polyadenylation signal.

Eukaryotes RNA polymerase I makes rRNA, the most common (rampant) type; present only in nucleolus. RNA polymerase II makes mRNA (massive), microRNA (miRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). RNA polymerase III makes 5S rRNA, tRNA (tiny). No proofreading function, but can initiate chains. RNA polymerase II opens DNA at promoter site.

I, II, and III are numbered in the same order that their products are used in protein synthesis: rRNA, mRNA, then tRNA.

α-amanitin, found in Amanita phalloides (death cap mushrooms), inhibits RNA polymerase II. Causes severe hepatotoxicity if ingested.

Actinomycin D, also called dactinomycin, inhibits RNA polymerase in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Prokaryotes 1 RNA polymerase (multisubunit complex) Rifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA makes all 3 kinds of RNA. polymerase in prokaryotes.

Splicing of pre-mRNA Part of process by which precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is transformed into mature mRNA.

Structure 75–90 nucleotides, 2º structure, cloverleaf form, anticodon end is opposite 3′ aminoacyl end. All tRNAs, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, have CCA at 3′ end along with a high percentage of chemically modified bases. The amino acid is covalently bound to the 3′ end of the tRNA. CCA Can Carry Amino acids. T-arm: contains the TΨC (ribothymidine, pseudouridine, cytidine) sequence necessary for tRNAribosome binding. T-arm Tethers tRNA molecule to ribosome. D-arm: contains Dihydrouridine residues necessary for tRNA recognition by the correct aminoacyltRNA synthetase. D-arm allows Detection of the tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Attachment site: the 5′-CCA-3′ is the amino acid acceptor site.

Charging Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (uses ATP; 1 unique enzyme per respective amino acid) and binding of charged tRNA to the codon are responsible for the accuracy of amino acid selection. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase matches an amino acid to the tRNA by scrutinizing the amino acid before and after it binds to tRNA. If an incorrect amino acid is attached, the bond is hydrolyzed. A mischarged tRNA reads the usual codon but inserts the wrong amino acid.

3. eIFs released when the mRNA and the ribosomal 60S subunit assemble with the complex. Requires GTP.

Aminoacyl-tRNA binds to A site (except for initiator methionine, which binds the P site), requires an elongation factor and GTP. rRNA (“ribozyme”) catalyzes peptide bond formation, transfers growing polypeptide to amino acid in A site.

Ribosome advances 3 nucleotides toward 3′ end of mRNA, moving peptidyl tRNA to P site (translocation).

ATP—tRNA Activation (charging).

GTP—tRNA Gripping and Going places (translocation).

Think of “going APE”: A site = incoming Aminoacyl-tRNA. P site = accommodates growing Peptide. E site = holds Empty tRNA as it Exits.

Termination Eukaryotic release factors (eRFs) recognize the stop codon and halt translation • completed polypeptide is released from ribosome. Requires GTP.

Trimming Removal of Nor C-terminal propeptides from zymogen to generate mature protein (eg, trypsinogen to trypsin).

Covalent alterations Phosphorylation, glycosylation, hydroxylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination.

Chaperone protein Intracellular protein involved in facilitating and maintaining protein folding. In yeast, heat shock proteins (eg, HSP60) are expressed at high temperatures to prevent protein denaturing/misfolding.

Cell cycle phases Checkpoints control transitions between phases of cell cycle. This process is regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and tumor suppressors. M phase (shortest phase of cell cycle) includes mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and cytokinesis (cytoplasm splits in two). G1 and G0 are of variable duration.

Proteins within organelles (eg, ER, Golgi bodies, lysosomes) are formed in RER.

Cell trafficking Golgi is distribution center for proteins and lipids from ER to vesicles and plasma membrane. Posttranslational events in Golgi include modifying N-oligosaccharides on asparagine, adding O-oligosaccharides on serine and threonine, and adding mannose-6-phosphate to proteins for lysosomal trafficking. Endosomes are sorting centers for material from outside the cell or from the Golgi, sending it to lysosomes for destruction or back to the membrane/Golgi for further use.

Cross-linking takes place extracellularly and gives elastin its elastic properties. Broken down by elastase, which is normally inhibited by α1-antitrypsin. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency results in unopposed elastase activity, which can cause COPD. Changes with aging:  dermal collagen and elastin,  synthesis of collagen fibrils; cross-linking remains normal. Marfan syndrome—autosomal dominant (with variable expression) connective tissue disorder affecting skeleton, heart, and eyes. FBN1 gene mutation on chromosome 15 (fifteen) results in defective fibrillin, a glycoprotein that forms a sheath around elastin.

Subluxation of lenses, typically upward and temporally (vs downward and medially in homocystinuria).

Polymerase chain Molecular biology lab procedure used to amplify a desired fragment of DNA. Useful as a diagnostic reaction tool (eg, neonatal HIV, herpes encephalitis).

Denaturation—DNA is heated to ~95°C to separate the strands. Annealing—Sample is cooled to ~55°C. DNA primers, a heat-stable DNA polymerase (Taq), and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) are added. DNA primers anneal to the specific sequence to be amplified on each strand. Elongation—Temperature is increased to ~72°C. DNA polymerase attaches dNTPs to the strand to replicate the sequence after each primer.

Heating and cooling cycles continue until the DNA sample size is sufficient.

Heteroplasmy Presence of both normal and mutated mtDNA passed from mother to all children. mtDNA, resulting in variable expression in mitochondrially inherited disease.

Uniparental disomy Offspring receives 2 copies of a chromosome from 1 parent and no copies from the other parent. HeterodIsomy (heterozygous) indicates a meiosis I error. IsodIsomy (homozygous) indicates a meiosis II error or postzygotic chromosomal duplication of one of a pair of chromosomes, and loss of the other of the original pair.

Uniparental is euploid (correct number of chromosomes). Most occurrences of uniparental disomy (UPD)  normal phenotype. Consider isodisomy in an individual manifesting a recessive disorder when only one parent is a carrier. Examples: Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.

If p and q represent the frequencies of alleles A and a, respectively, in a population, then p + q = 1: p2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele A q2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele a 2pq = frequency of heterozygosity (carrier frequency, if an autosomal recessive disease) Therefore, the sum of the frequencies of these genotypes is p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.

The frequency of an X-linked recessive disease in males = q and in females = q2.

Hardy-Weinberg law assumptions include:

No mutation occurring at the locus

Natural selection is not occurring

If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, then the values of p and q remain constant from generation to generation.

GENETICS Autosomal recessive; defect in CFTR gene on chromosome 7; commonly a deletion of Phe508. Most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasian population.

PATHOPHYSIOlOGY CFTR encodes an ATP-gated Cl− channel that secretes Cl− in lungs and GI tract, and reabsorbs Cl− in sweat glands. Most common mutation  misfolded protein  protein retained in RER and not transported to cell membrane, causing  Cl− (and H2O) secretion;  intracellular Cl− results in compensatory • Na+ reabsorption via epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC)  H2O reabsorption  abnormally thick mucus secreted into lungs and GI tract.  Na+ reabsorption also causes more negative transepithelial potential difference.

DIAGNOSIS  Cl− concentration in pilocarpine-induced sweat test is diagnostic. Can present with contraction alkalosis and hypokalemia (ECF effects analogous to a patient taking a loop diuretic) because of ECF H2O/Na+ losses via sweating and concomitant renal K+/H+ wasting. • immunoreactive trypsinogen (newborn screening).

COMPlICATIONS Recurrent pulmonary infections (eg, S aureus [infancy and early childhood], P aeruginosa [adulthood], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA]), chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis  reticulonodular pattern on CXR, opacification of sinuses. Pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption with steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K), biliary cirrhosis, liver disease. Meconium ileus in newborns. Infertility in men (absence of vas deferens, spermatogenesis may be unaffected) and subfertility in women (amenorrhea, abnormally thick cervical mucus). Nasal polyps, clubbing of nails.

TREATMENT Multifactorial: chest physiotherapy, albuterol, aerosolized dornase alfa (DNase), and hypertonic saline facilitate mucus clearance. Azithromycin used as anti-inflammatory agent. Ibuprofen slows disease progression. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic insufficiency. In patients with Phe508 deletion: combination of lumacaftor (corrects misfolded proteins and improves their transport to cell surface) and ivacaftor (opens Cl– channels • improved chloride transport).

Phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by glucokinase in the liver and hexokinase in other tissues. Hexokinase sequesters glucose in tissues, where it is used even when glucose concentrations are low. At high glucose concentrations, glucokinase helps to store glucose in liver.

Functions of different pyruvate metabolic pathways (and their associated cofactors): Alanine aminotransferase (B6): alanine carries amino groups to the liver from muscle Pyruvate carboxylase (biotin): oxaloacetate can replenish TCA cycle or be used in gluconeogenesis Pyruvate dehydrogenase (B1, B2, B3, B5, lipoic acid): transition from glycolysis to the TCA cycle Lactic acid dehydrogenase (B3): end of anaerobic glycolysis (major pathway in RBCs, WBCs, kidney medulla, lens, testes, and cornea)

Also called Krebs cycle. Pyruvate  acetyl-CoA produces 1 NADH, 1 CO2.

The TCA cycle produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, 2 CO2, 1 GTP per acetyl-CoA = 10 ATP/ acetyl-CoA (2× everything per glucose). TCA cycle reactions occur in the mitochondria.

Citrate Is Krebs’ Starting Substrate For Making Oxaloacetate.

Electron transport NADH electrons from glycolysis enter mitochondria via the malate-aspartate or glycerol-3chain and oxidative phosphate shuttle. FADH2 electrons are transferred to complex II (at a lower energy level than phosphorylation NADH). The passage of electrons results in the formation of a proton gradient that, coupled to oxidative phosphorylation, drives the production of ATP.

Occurs primarily in liver; serves to maintain euglycemia during fasting. Enzymes also found in kidney, intestinal epithelium. Deficiency of the key gluconeogenic enzymes causes hypoglycemia. (Muscle cannot participate in gluconeogenesis because it lacks glucose-6-phosphatase).

Odd-chain fatty acids yield 1 propionyl-CoA during metabolism, which can enter the TCA cycle (as succinyl-CoA), undergo gluconeogenesis, and serve as a glucose source. Even-chain fatty acids cannot produce new glucose, since they yield only acetyl-CoA equivalents.

Also called HMP shunt. Provides a source of NADPH from abundantly available glucose-6-P (NADPH is required for reductive reactions, eg, glutathione reduction inside RBCs, fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis). Additionally, this pathway yields ribose for nucleotide synthesis. Two distinct phases (oxidative and nonoxidative), both of which occur in the cytoplasm. No ATP is used or produced.

Sites: lactating mammary glands, liver, adrenal cortex (sites of fatty acid or steroid synthesis), RBCs.

NADPH is necessary to keep glutathione reduced, which in turn detoxifies free radicals and peroxides.  NADPH in RBCs leads to hemolytic anemia due to poor RBC defense against oxidizing agents (eg, fava beans, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, primaquine/ chloroquine, antituberculosis drugs). Infection (most common cause) can also precipitate hemolysis; inflammatory response produces free radicals that diffuse into RBCs, causing oxidative damage.

Disorders of fructose metabolism

Essential fructosuria Involves a defect in fructokinase. Autosomal recessive. A benign, asymptomatic condition (fructokinase deficiency is kinder), since fructose is not trapped in cells. Hexokinase becomes 1° pathway for converting fructose to fructose-6-phosphate. Symptoms: fructose appears in blood and urine. Disorders of fructose metabolism cause milder symptoms than analogous disorders of galactose metabolism.

Hereditary deficiency of aldolase B. Autosomal recessive. Fructose-1-phosphate accumulates, causing a  in available phosphate, which results in inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Symptoms present following consumption of fruit, juice, or honey. Urine dipstick will be ⊝ (tests for glucose only); reducing sugar can be detected in the urine (nonspecific test for inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism).

Symptoms: hypoglycemia, jaundice, cirrhosis, vomiting.

Treatment:  intake of fructose, sucrose (glucose + fructose), and sorbitol (metabolized to fructose).

Disorders of galactose metabolism

Hereditary deficiency of galactokinase. Galactitol accumulates if galactose is present in diet.

Fructose is to Aldolase B as Galactose is to

UridylTransferase (FAB GUT).

The more serious defects lead to PO43− depletion.

Sorbitol An alternative method of trapping glucose in the cell is to convert it to its alcohol counterpart, sorbitol, via aldose reductase. Some tissues then convert sorbitol to fructose using sorbitol dehydrogenase; tissues with an insufficient amount/activity of this enzyme are at risk of intracellular sorbitol accumulation, causing osmotic damage (eg, cataracts, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy seen with chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes). High blood levels of galactose also result in conversion to the osmotically active galactitol via aldose reductase. Liver, Ovaries, and Seminal vesicles have both enzymes (they LOSe sorbitol).

Lens has primarily aldose reductase. Retina, Kidneys, and Schwann cells have only aldose reductase (LuRKS).

Lactase deficiency Insufficient lactase enzyme  dietary lactose intolerance. Lactase functions on the intestinal brush border to digest lactose (in milk and milk products) into glucose and galactose. Primary: age-dependent decline after childhood (absence of lactase-persistent allele), common in people of Asian, African, or Native American descent. Secondary: loss of intestinal brush border due to gastroenteritis (eg, rotavirus), autoimmune disease. Congenital lactase deficiency: rare, due to defective gene. Stool demonstrates  pH and breath shows  hydrogen content with lactose hydrogen breath test.

Intestinal biopsy reveals normal mucosa in patients with hereditary lactose intolerance.

FINDINGS Bloating, cramps, flatulence, osmotic diarrhea.

TREATMENT Avoid dairy products or add lactase pills to diet; lactose-free milk.

Most common urea cycle disorder. X-linked recessive (vs other urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, which are autosomal recessive). Interferes with the body’s ability to eliminate ammonia. Often evident in the first few days of life, but may present later. Excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted to orotic acid (part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway).

I Love Vermont maple syrup from maple trees (with B1ranches).

Blocked degradation of branched amino acids (Isoleucine, Leucine, Valine) due to • branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (B1). Causes • α-ketoacids in the blood, especially those of leucine.

Treatment: restriction of isoleucine, leucine, valine in diet, and thiamine supplementation.

Congenital deficiency of homogentisate oxidase in the degradative pathway of tyrosine to fumarate • pigment-forming homogentisic acid builds up in tissue A . Autosomal recessive. Usually benign.

Findings: bluish-black connective tissue, ear cartilage, and sclerae (ochronosis); urine turns black on prolonged exposure to air. May have debilitating arthralgias (homogentisic acid toxic to cartilage).

In homocystinuria, lens subluxes “down and in” (vs Marfan, “up and fans out”).

Hereditary defect of renal PCT and intestinal amino acid transporter that prevents reabsorption of Cystine, Ornithine, Lysine, and Arginine (COLA).

Excess cystine in the urine can lead to recurrent precipitation of hexagonal cystine stones A .

Autosomal recessive. Common (1:7000). Urinary cyanide-nitroprusside test is diagnostic.

Cystine is made of 2 cysteines connected by a disulfide bond.

Organic acidemias Most commonly present in infancy with poor feeding, vomiting, hypotonia, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, hepatomegaly, seizures. Organic acid accumulation:

Glycogen Branches have α-(1,6) bonds; linkages have α-(1,4) bonds.

Skeletal muscle Glycogen undergoes glycogenolysis  glucose-1-phosphate  glucose-6-phosphate, which is rapidly metabolized during exercise.

Hepatocytes Glycogen is stored and undergoes glycogenolysis to maintain blood sugar at appropriate levels. Glycogen phosphorylase liberates glucose-1-phosphate residues off branched glycogen until 4 glucose units remain on a branch. Then 4-α-d-glucanotransferase (debranching enzyme ) moves 3 of the 4 glucose units from the branch to the linkage. Then α-1,6-glucosidase (debranching enzyme ) cleaves off the last residue, liberating glucose. “Limit dextrin” refers to the two to four residues remaining on a branch after glycogen phosphorylase (˜-1,6-glucosidase) ˜-1,4-glucosidase

Note: A small amount of glycogen is degraded in lysosomes by α-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase).

Fatty acid synthesis requires transport of citrate from mitochondria to cytosol. Predominantly occurs in liver, lactating mammary glands, and adipose tissue.

Long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) degradation requires carnitine-dependent transport into the mitochondrial matrix.

“SYtrate” = SYnthesis. CARnitine = CARnage of fatty acids.

Systemic 1° carnitine deficiency—no cellular uptake of carnitine  no transport of LCFAs into mitochondria  toxic accumulation of LCFAs in the cytosol. Causes weakness, hypotonia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, dilated cardiomyopathy.

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency— ability to break down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA • accumulation of fatty acyl carnitines in the blood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Causes vomiting, lethargy, seizures, coma, liver dysfunction, hyperammonemia. Can lead to sudden death in infants or children. Treat by avoiding fasting.

Ketone bodies In the liver, fatty acids and amino acids are metabolized to acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (to be used in muscle and brain). In prolonged starvation and diabetic ketoacidosis, oxaloacetate is depleted for gluconeogenesis. In alcoholism, excess NADH shunts oxaloacetate to malate. All of these processes lead to a buildup of acetyl-CoA, which is shunted into ketone body synthesis.

Ketone bodies: acetone, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate. Breath smells like acetone (fruity odor). Urine test for ketones can detect acetoacetate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate. RBCs cannot utilize ketones; they strictly use glucose. HMG-CoA lyase for ketone production. HMG-CoA reductase for cholesterol synthesis.

Duration of exercise

Fasting and starvation Priorities are to supply sufficient glucose to the brain and RBCs and to preserve protein.

Fed state (after a Glycolysis and aerobic respiration. meal) Fasting (between Hepatic glycogenolysis (major); hepatic meals) gluconeogenesis, adipose release of FFA (minor). Starvation days 1–3 Blood glucose levels maintained by:

Adipose release of FFA

Muscle and liver, which shift fuel use from glucose to FFA

Insulin stimulates storage of lipids, proteins, and glycogen. Glucagon and epinephrine stimulate use of fuel reserves. Glycogen reserves depleted after day 1. RBCs lack mitochondria and therefore cannot use ketones. Weeks of starvation Carbohydrate Protein Fat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 80 2 10 12 0 Starvation after day 3 Adipose stores (ketone bodies become the main source of energy for the brain). After these are depleted, vital protein degradation accelerates, leading to organ failure and death. Amount of excess stores determines survival time.

Learning the components of the immune system and their roles in host defense at the cellular level is essential for both the understanding of disease pathophysiology and clinical practice. Know the immune mechanisms of responses to vaccines. Both congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies are very testable. Cell surface markers are high yield for understanding immune cell interactions and for laboratory diagnosis. Know the roles and functions of major cytokines and chemokines.

Functions of natural Lymphocyte member of innate immune system.

killer cells Use perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis of virally infected cells and tumor cells. Activity enhanced by IL-2, IL-12, IFN-α, and IFN-β. Induced to kill when exposed to a nonspecific activation signal on target cell and/or to an absence of MHC I on target cell surface. Also kills via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CD16 binds Fc region of bound IgG, activating the NK cell).

Major functions of B and T cells

B cells Humoral immunity. Recognize and present antigen—undergo somatic hypermutation to optimize antigen specificity. Produce antibody—differentiate into plasma cells to secrete specific immunoglobulins. Maintain immunologic memory—memory B cells persist and accelerate future response to antigen.

T cells Cell-mediated immunity. CD4+ T cells help B cells make antibodies and produce cytokines to recruit phagocytes and activate other leukocytes. CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected and tumor cells via perforin and granzymes (similar to NK cells). Delayed cell-mediated hypersensitivity (type IV). Acute and chronic cellular organ rejection. Rule of 8: MHC II × CD4 = 8; MHC I × CD8 = 8.

Tand B-cell activation APCs: B cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages. Two signals are required for T-cell activation, B-cell activation, and class switching.

Th-cell activation as above. R B-cell receptor–mediated endocytosis. Exogenous antigen is presented on MHC II and recognized by TCR on Th cell. CD40 receptor on B cell binds CD40 ligand (CD40L) on Th cell. Th cells secrete cytokines that determine Ig class switching of B cells. B cells are activated, undergo class switching and affinity maturation, and begin producing antibodies.

ComplementactivationMembrane attack complex (MAC) Antibody activates complement, enhancing opsonization and lysis C3b OpsonizationNeutralizationAntibody prevents bacterial adherence Antibody promotes phagocytosis

IgG Main antibody in 2° response to an antigen. Most abundant isotype in serum. Fixes complement, opsonizes bacteria, neutralizes bacterial toxins and viruses. Only isotype that crosses the placenta (provides infants with passive immunity that starts to wane after birth). “IgGGreets the Growing fetus.”

Prevents attachment of bacteria and viruses to mucous membranes; does not fix complement. Monomer (in circulation) or dimer (with J chain when secreted). Crosses epithelial cells by transcytosis. Produced in GI tract (eg, by Peyer patches) and protects against gut infections (eg, Giardia). Most produced antibody overall, but has lower serum concentrations. Released into secretions (tears, saliva, mucus) and breast milk. Picks up secretory component from epithelial cells, which protects the Fc portion from luminal proteases.

IgM Produced in the 1° (immediate) response to an antigen. Fixes complement. Antigen receptor on the surface of B cells. Monomer on B cell, pentamer with J chain when secreted. Pentamer enables avid binding to antigen while humoral response evolves.

IgD Unclear function. Found on surface of many B cells and in serum.

IgE Binds mast cells and basophils; cross-links when exposed to allergen, mediating immediate (type I) hypersensitivity through release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. Contributes to immunity to parasites by activating eosinophils.

Opsonins—C3b and IgG are the two 1° Opsonin (Greek) = to prepare for eating. opsonins in bacterial defense; enhance phagocytosis. C3b also helps clear immune complexes.

Important cytokines Acute (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), then recruit (IL-8, IL-12).

Respiratory burst Also called oxidative burst. Involves the activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex (eg, in neutrophils, monocytes), which utilizes O2 as a substrate. Plays an important role in the immune response  rapid release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH plays a role in both the creation and neutralization of ROS. Myeloperoxidase contains a blue-green, heme-containing pigment that gives sputum its color.

Phagocytes of patients with CGD can utilize H2O2 generated by invading organisms and convert it to ROS. Patients are at  risk for infection by catalase ⊕ species (eg, S aureus, Aspergillus) capable of neutralizing their own H2O2, leaving phagocytes without ROS for fighting infections.

Pyocyanin of P aeruginosa generates ROS to kill competing pathogens. Oxidative burst also leads to K+ influx, which releases lysosomal enzymes. Lactoferrin is a protein found in secretory fluids and neutrophils that inhibits microbial growth via iron chelation.

Interferons IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ mechanISm A part of innate host defense, interferons interfere with both RNA and DNA viruses. Cells infected with a virus synthesize these glycoproteins, which act on local cells, priming them for viral defense by downregulating protein synthesis to resist potential viral replication and by upregulating MHC expression to facilitate recognition of infected cells. Also play a major role in activating antitumor immunity.

Anergy State during which a cell cannot become activated by exposure to its antigen. T and B cells become anergic when exposed to their antigen without costimulatory signal (signal 2). Another mechanism of self-tolerance.

Vaccination Induces an active immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to specific pathogens.

Hypersensitivity types Four types (ABCD): Anaphylactic and Atopic (type I), AntiBody-mediated (type II), Immune Complex (type III), Delayed (cell-mediated, type IV). Types I, II, and III are all antibody-mediated.

Antibodies bind to cell-surface antigens  cellular destruction, inflammation, and cellular dysfunction.

Cellular destruction—cell is opsonized (coated) by antibodies, leading to either:

Phagocytosis and/or activation of complement system.

NK cell killing (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity).

Inflammation—binding of antibodies to cell surfaces  activation of complement system and Fc receptor-mediated inflammation.

Cellular dysfunction—antibodies bind to cell surface receptors  abnormal blockade or activation of downstream process.

Direct Coombs test—detects antibodies attached directly to the RBC surface. Indirect Coombs test—detects presence of unbound antibodies in the serum

Examples:

Hemolytic disease of the newborn

Examples:

Hyperacute transplant rejection Examples:

Immune complex—antigen-antibody (mostly IgG) complexes activate complement, which attracts neutrophils; neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes.

Can be associated with vasculitis and systemic manifestations.

Serum sickness—the prototypic immune complex disease. Antibodies to foreign proteins are produced and 1–2 weeks later, antibody-antigen complexes form and deposit in tissues  complement activation • inflammation and tissue damage.

Arthus reaction—a local subacute immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Intradermal injection of antigen into a presensitized (has circulating IgG) individual leads to immune complex formation in the skin (eg, enhanced local reaction to a booster vaccination). Characterized by edema, necrosis, and activation of complement.

In type III reaction, imagine an immune complex as 3 things stuck together: antigenantibody-complement.

Examples:

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Fever, urticaria, arthralgia, proteinuria, lymphadenopathy occur 1–2 weeks after antigen exposure. Serum sickness-like reactions are associated with some drugs (may act as haptens, eg, penicillin) and infections (eg, hepatitis B).

Two mechanisms, each involving T cells: 1.

Direct cell cytotoxicity: CD8+ cytotoxic T cells kill targeted cells.

2.

Inflammatory reaction: effector CD4+ T cells recognize antigen and release inflammation-inducing cytokines (shown in illustration).

Response does not involve antibodies (vs types I, II, and III). Examples: contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy, nickel allergy) and graft-versus-host disease.

Tests: PPD for TB infection; patch test for contact dermatitis; Candida skin test for T cell immune function.

Adrenal insufficiency may develop if drug is stopped abruptly after chronic use “Support bacteria. They’re the only culture some people have.” “What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters  compared to what lies within us.” —Henry S. Haskins “Infectious disease is merely a disagreeable instance of a widely prevalent tendency of all living creatures to save themselves the bother of building, by their own efforts, the things they require.”

Microbiology questions on the Step 1 exam often require two (or more) steps: Given a certain clinical presentation, you will first need to identify the most likely causative organism, and you will then need to provide an answer regarding some features of that organism or relevant antimicrobial agents. For example, a description of a child with fever and a petechial rash will be followed by a question that reads, “From what site does the responsible organism usually enter the blood?”

This section therefore presents organisms in two major ways: in individual microbial “profiles” and in the context of the systems they infect and the clinical presentations they produce. You should become familiar with both formats. When reviewing the systems approach, remind yourself of the features of each microbe by returning to the individual profiles. Also be sure to memorize the laboratory characteristics that allow you to identify microbes.

Properties of growth media The same type of media can possess both (or neither) of these properties.

Selective media Favors the growth of particular organism while preventing growth of other organisms. Example: Thayer-Martin agar contains antibiotics that allow the selective growth of Neisseria by inhibiting the growth of other sensitive organisms.

Aerobes Use an O2-dependent system to generate ATP. Examples include Nocardia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Bordetella pertussis. Reactivation of M tuberculosis (eg, after immunocompromise or TNF-α inhibitor use) has a predilection for the apices of the lung.

Anaerobes Examples include Clostridium, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces israelii. They lack catalase and/or superoxide dismutase and are thus susceptible to oxidative damage. Generally foul smelling (short-chain fatty acids), are difficult to culture, and produce gas in tissue (CO2 and H2).

Anaerobes Can’t Breathe Fresh Air.

Anaerobes are normal flora in GI tract, typically pathogenic elsewhere. AminO2glycosides are ineffective against anaerobes because these antibiotics require O2 to enter into bacterial cell.

Examples are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae A , Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and group B Strep. Their capsules serve as an antiphagocytic virulence factor.

Capsular polysaccharide + protein conjugate serves as an antigen in vaccines.

Are opsonized, and then cleared by spleen. Asplenics (No Spleen Here) have  opsonizing ability and thus  risk for severe infections; need vaccines to protect against:

Some vaccines containing polysaccharide capsule antigens are conjugated to a carrier protein, enhancing immunogenicity by promoting T-cell activation and subsequent class switching. A polysaccharide antigen alone cannot be presented to T cells.

Pneumococcal vaccines: PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with no conjugated protein).

H influenzae type b (conjugate vaccine).

Meningococcal vaccine (conjugate vaccine).

Catalase-positive Catalase degrades H2O2 into H2O and bubbles of O2 A before it can be converted to microbicidal organisms products by the enzyme myeloperoxidase. People with chronic granulomatous disease (NADPH oxidase deficiency) have recurrent infections with certain catalase ⊕ organisms.

Examples: Nocardia, Staphylococci, Serratia, Candida, Listeria, E coli, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis.

Viridans streptococci (S mutans, S sanguinis) Dental plaques, infective endocarditis

P aeruginosa Respiratory tree colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia Contact lens–associated keratitis

Some gram ⊕ bacteria can form spores A when nutrients are limited. Spores lack metabolic activity and are highly resistant to heat and chemicals. Core contains dipicolinic acid. Must autoclave to kill spores (as is done to surgical equipment) by steaming at 121°C for 15 minutes.

Examples: B anthracis (anthrax), B cereus (food poisoning), C botulinum (botulism), C difficile (pseudomembranous colitis), C perfringens (gas gangrene), C tetani (tetanus).

Bacterial virulence factors These promote evasion of host immune response.

pieces of environmental naked bacterial chromosomal DNA (from bacterial cell lysis). The transfer and expression of newly transferred genes is called transformation. A feature of many bacteria, especially S pneumoniae, Hinfluenzae type b, and Neisseria (SHiN).

Transfer of leading part of plasmid and a few flanking F+ cell F– cell Hfr cellF– cell Hfr cell F– cell Hfr cell Recombinant chromosomal genes. High-frequency recombination may integrate some of those bacterial genes. Recipient cell remains F– but now may have new bacterial genes.

Generalized A packaging “error.” Lytic phage infects Cleavage of Bacterial DNA packaged bacterium, leading to cleavage of bacterial phage DNA. Parts of bacterial chromosomal DNA may become packaged in phage capsid. Phage infects another bacterium, transferring these genes.

Release of new phage Infects other Genes transferred from lysed cell bacteria to new bacteria

Specialized An “excision” event. Lysogenic phage infects bacterium; viral DNA incorporates into bacterial chromosome. When phage DNA is excised, flanking bacterial genes may be excised with it. DNA is packaged into phage capsid and can infect another bacterium. Genes for the following 5 bacterial toxins are encoded in a lysogenic phage (ABCD’S): Group A strep erythrogenic toxin, Botulinum toxin, Cholera toxin, Diphtheria toxin, Shiga toxin.

Release of new phage Infects other Genes di˜erent from from lysed cell bacteria donor and recipient (specialized segment of DNA), which can copy and excise itself and then insert into the same DNA molecule or an unrelated DNA (eg,

Integration of genes Transposon plasmid or chromosome). Critical in creating plasmids with multiple drug resistance and DNA transfer across species lines (eg, Tn1546 with vanA from Enterococcus to S aureus).

“Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of health; everything unconditional belongs in pathology.” “You cannot separate passion from pathology any more than you can separate a person’s spirit from his body.”

The fundamental principles of pathology are key to understanding diseases in all organ systems. Major topics such as inflammation and neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems, and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example, esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Finally, make sure you recognize the major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis.

Apoptosis ATP-dependent programmed cell death. Intrinsic and extrinsic pathways; both pathways activate caspases (cytosolic proteases)  cellular breakdown including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies, which are then phagocytosed. Characterized by deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm and basophilic nucleus, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis. Cell membrane typically remains intact without significant inflammation (unlike necrosis). DNA laddering (fragments in multiples of 180 bp) is a sensitive indicator of apoptosis.

Ischemia Inadequate blood supply to meet demand. Mechanisms include  arterial perfusion (eg, atherosclerosis),  venous drainage (eg, testicular torsion, Budd-Chiari syndrome), shock. Regions most vulnerable to hypoxia/ischemia and subsequent infarction:

Brain ACA/MCA/PCA boundary areasa,b

Colon Splenic flexure (Griffith point),a rectosigmoid junction (Sudeck point)a aWatershed areas (border zones) receive blood supply from most distal branches of 2 arteries with limited collateral vascularity. These areas are susceptible to ischemia from hypoperfusion. bNeurons most vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic insults include Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and neocortex (zones 3, 5, 6).

Types of infarcts

Red infarct Occurs in venous occlusion and tissues with multiple blood supplies (eg, liver, lung A , intestine, testes), and with reperfusion (eg, after angioplasty). Reperfusion injury is due to damage by free radicals.

Pale infarct Occurs in solid organs with a single (endarterial) blood supply (eg, heart, kidney B ).

Free radical injury Free radicals damage cells via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA breakage. Initiated via radiation exposure (eg, cancer therapy), metabolism of drugs (phase I), redox reactions, nitric oxide (eg, inflammation), transition metals, WBC (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) oxidative burst. Free radicals can be eliminated by scavenging enzymes (eg, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), spontaneous decay, antioxidants (eg, vitamins A, C, E), and certain metal carrier proteins (eg, transferrin, ceruloplasmin). Examples:

Oxygen toxicity: retinopathy of prematurity (abnormal vascularization), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, reperfusion injury after thrombolytic therapy

Drug/chemical toxicity: acetaminophen overdose (hepatotoxicity), carbon tetrachloride (converted by cytochrome P-450 into CCl3 free radical  fatty liver [cell injury • apolipoprotein synthesis  fatty change], centrilobular necrosis)

Metal storage diseases: hemochromatosis (iron) and Wilson disease (copper)

Hematologic (eg, easy bruising, splenomegaly)

Neurologic (eg, neuropathy)

Musculoskeletal (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome)

Inflammation Response to eliminate initial cause of cell injury, to remove necrotic cells resulting from the original insult, and to initiate tissue repair. Divided into acute and chronic. The inflammatory response itself can be harmful to the host if the reaction is excessive (eg, septic shock), prolonged (eg, persistent infections such as TB), or inappropriate (eg, autoimmune diseases such as SLE).

Fever Pyrogens (eg, LPS) induce macrophages to release IL-1 and TNF  COX activity in perivascular cells of hypothalamus • PGE2  temperature set point Acute inflammation Transient and early response to injury or infection. Characterized by neutrophils in tissue A , often with associated edema. Rapid onset (seconds to minutes) and short duration (minutes to days).

Scar formation Occurs when repair cannot be accomplished by cell regeneration alone. Nonregenerated cells (2° to severe acute or chronic injury) are replaced by connective tissue. 70–80% of tensile strength regained at 3 months; little tensile strength regained thereafter. Associated with excess TGF-β.

Normal cells Normal cells with basal  apical polarity. See cervical example A , which shows normal cells and spectrum of dysplasia, as discussed below.

Cells have invaded basement membrane using collagenases and hydrolases (metalloproteinases). Cell-cell contacts lost by inactivation of E-cadherin.

Metastasis Spread to distant organ(s) via lymphatics or blood.

Tumor nomenclature Carcinoma implies epithelial origin, whereas sarcoma denotes mesenchymal origin. Both terms generally imply malignancy. Benign tumors are usually well-differentiated and well-demarcated, with low mitotic activity, no metastases, and no necrosis. Malignant tumors (cancers) may show poor differentiation, erratic growth, local invasion, metastasis, and • apoptosis.

Terms for non-neoplastic malformations include hamartoma (disorganized overgrowth of tissues in their native location, eg, Peutz-Jeghers polyps) and choristoma (normal tissue in a foreign location, eg, gastric tissue located in distal ileum in Meckel diverticulum).

Epithelium Adenoma, papilloma Adenocarcinoma, papillary carcinoma

Tumor grade vs stage Differentiation—degree to which a tumor resembles its tissue of origin. Well-differentiated tumors (often less aggressive) closely resemble their tissue of origin, whereas poorly differentiated tumors (often more aggressive) do not.

Anaplasia—complete lack of differentiation of cells in a malignant neoplasm.

Grade Degree of cellular differentiation and mitotic activity on histology. Ranges from low grade (well-differentiated) to high grade (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated, or anaplastic). Low grade High grade

Stage Degree of localization/spread based on site and size of 1° lesion, spread to regional lymph nodes, presence of metastases. Based on clinical (c) or pathologic (p) findings. Stage T generally has more prognostic value than

TNM staging system (Stage = Spread):

Spread to otherT = Tumor size/invasiveness, N = Node organs and tissues involvement, M = Metastases, eg, cT3N1M0. Each TNM factor has independent prognostic value; N and M are often most important.

Cancer epidemiology Skin cancer (basal > squamous >> melanoma) is the most common cancer (not included below).

Preparation for pharmacology questions is straightforward. Know all the mechanisms, clinical use, and important adverse effects of key drugs and their major variants. Obscure derivatives are low-yield. Learn their classic and distinguishing toxicities as well as major drug-drug interactions. Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology concepts can be useful while studying pharmacology. The exam has a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are comfortable interpreting them.

A heterogenous mix of epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, law, healthcare delivery, patient safety, quality improvement, and more falls under the heading of public health sciences. Biostatistics and epidemiology are the foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also, know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then asked how you would respond.

Study quality improves when study is randomized, controlled, and double-blinded (ie, neither patient nor doctor knows whether the patient is in the treatment or control group). Triple-blind refers to the additional blinding of the researchers analyzing the data. Four phases (“Does the drug SWIM?”).

Evaluation of Sensitivity and specificity are fixed properties Disease diagnostic tests of a test. PPV and NPV vary depending on disease prevalence in population being tested.

SN-N-OUT = highly SeNsitive test, when Negative, rules OUT disease

SP-P-IN = highly SPecific test, when Positive, rules IN disease

PPV varies directly with pretest probability (baseline risk, such as prevalence of disease):

NPV varies inversely with prevalence or pretest

Quantifying risk Definitions and formulas are based on the classic 2 × 2 or contingency table.

Odds ratio Typically used in case-control If in a case-control study, 20/30 lung  a/c ad studies. Represents the odds of cancer patients and 5/25 healthy b/d bc exposure among cases (a/c) vs individuals report smoking, the OR odds of exposure among controls is 8; so the lung cancer patients are 8 (b/d). times more likely to have a history of smoking.

Relative risk Typically used in cohort studies. Risk of developing disease in the exposed group divided by risk in the unexposed group. RR = 1  no association between exposure and disease. RR > 1  exposure associated with occurrence. RR < 1  exposure associated with disease occurrence.

If 5/10 people exposed to radiation are a/(a + b) diagnosed with cancer, and 1/10 people c/(c + d) not exposed to radiation are diagnosed with cancer, the RR is 5; so people exposed to radiation have a 5 times greater risk of developing cancer.

For rare diseases (low prevalence), OR approximates RR.

Relative risk The proportion of risk reduction If 2% of patients who receive a flu RRR = 1 − RR reduction attributable to the intervention as shot develop the flu, while 8% of compared to a control. unvaccinated patients develop the flu, then RR = 2/8 = 0.25, and RRR = 0.75.

Attributable The difference in risk between If risk of lung cancer in smokers is 21% a c risk exposed and unexposed groups. and risk in nonsmokers is 1%, then the a + b c + d attributable risk is 20%. RR − 1

Absolute The difference in risk (not the If 8% of people who receive a placebo c a risk proportion) attributable to the vaccine develop the flu vs 2% of people c + d a + b reduction intervention as compared to a who receive a flu vaccine, then ARR = control. 8%–2% = 6% = 0.06.

Number Number of patients who need to NNT = 1/ARR needed to be treated for 1 patient to benefit. treat Lower number = better treatment.

Number Number of patients who need to NNH = 1/AR needed to be exposed to a risk factor for 1 harm patient to be harmed. Higher number = safer exposure.

Case fatality Percentage of deaths occurring If 4 patients die among 10 cases of deaths rate among those with disease. meningitis, case fatality rate is 40%. cases

Incidence vs   # of new cases  Incidence looks at new cases(incidents).

Incidence = (per unit of time) prevalence # of people at risk Prevalence =# of existing cases (at a point in Prevalence looks at all current cases.

 precision  statistical power (1 −β).

Accuracy (validity) The closeness of test results to the true values. Systematic error  accuracy in a test. The absence of systematic error or bias in a test.

The better performing test will have a higher area under the curve (AUC), with the curve closer to the upper left corner.

No predictive value (AUC = 0.5)TP rate (sensitivity) FP rate (1 – specifcity) 1 A ctual test (0.5 < AU C < 1 )

Selection bias Nonrandom sampling or treatment allocation of subjects such that study population is not representative of target population. Most commonly a sampling bias.

Berkson bias—cases and/ or controls selected from hospitals are less healthy and have different exposures than general population

Attrition bias—participants lost to follow up have a different prognosis than those who complete the study Randomization

Ensure the choice of the right comparison/reference group

Recall bias Awareness of disorder alters Patients with disease recall Decrease time from exposure recall by subjects; common in exposure after learning of to follow-up retrospective studies similar cases

Measurement bias Information is gathered in a Using a faulty automatic Use objective, standardized, systemically distorted manner sphygmomanometer to and previously tested methods measure BP of data collection that are Hawthorne effect—participants planned ahead of time change behavior upon Use placebo group awareness of being observed

Procedure bias Subjects in different groups are Patients in treatment group not treated the same spend more time in highly specialized hospital units

Blinding (masking) and use of placebo reduce influence of participants and researchers on procedures and interpretation of outcomes as neither are aware of group assignments

Confounding bias Factor related to both exposure and outcome (but not on causal path) distorts effect of exposure on outcome (vs effect modification, in which the exposure leads to different outcomes in subgroups stratified by the factor)

An uncontrolled study shows an association between drinking coffee and lung cancer. However, coffee drinkers also smoke more, which can account for the association Multiple/repeated studies

Crossover studies (subjects act as their own controls)

Matching (patients with similar characteristics in both treatment and control groups)

Lead-time bias Early detection is confused Early detection makes it seem Measure “back-end” survival with  survival like survival has increased, (adjust survival according to but the disease’s natural the severity of disease at the history has not changed time of diagnosis)

Length-time bias Screening test detects diseases A slowly progressive cancer A randomized controlled trial with long latency period, is more likely detected by a assigning subjects to the while those with shorter screening test than a rapidly screening program or to no latency period become progressive cancer screening symptomatic earlier

Mode = most common value. Least affected by outliers.

Bimodal Suggests two different populations (eg, metabolic polymorphism such as fast vs slow acetylators; age at onset of Hodgkin lymphoma; suicide rate by age).

Positive skew Typically, mean > median > mode.

Asymmetry with longer tail on right.

Negative skew Typically, mean < median < mode. Mode Asymmetry with longer tail on left.

Statistical hypotheses Outcomes of statistical hypothesis testing

Correct result Stating that there is an effect or difference when Reality one exists (null hypothesis rejected in favor of HH alternative hypothesis). Stating that there is no effect or difference when none exists (null hypothesis not rejected).

Blue shading = correct result.

Confidence interval Range of values within which the true mean of the population is expected to fall, with a specified probability.

CI for sample mean = x¯ ± Z(SE) The 95% CI (corresponding to α = .05) is often used. As sample size increases, CI narrows. For the 95% CI, Z = 1.96. For the 99% CI, Z = 2.58.

If the 95% CI for a mean difference between 2 variables includes 0, then there is no significant difference and H0 is not rejected.

If the 95% CI for odds ratio or relative risk includes 1, H0 is not rejected.

If the CIs between 2 groups do not overlap  statistically significant difference exists.

If the CIs between 2 groups overlap  usually no significant difference exists.

Meta-analysis A method of statistical analysis that pools summary data (eg, means, RRs) from multiple studies for a more precise estimate of the size of an effect. Also estimates heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies. Improves power, strength of evidence, and generalizability of study findings. Limited by quality of individual studies and bias in study selection.

Autonomy Obligation to respect patients as individuals (truth-telling, confidentiality), to create conditions necessary for autonomous choice (informed consent), and to honor their preference in accepting or not accepting medical care.

Beneficence Physicians have a special ethical (fiduciary) duty to act in the patient’s best interest. May conflict with autonomy (an informed patient has the right to decide) or what is best for society (eg, mandatory TB treatment). Traditionally, patient interest supersedes.

Nonmaleficence “Do no harm.” Must be balanced against beneficence; if the benefits outweigh the risks, a patient may make an informed decision to proceed (most surgeries and medications fall into this category).

Justice To treat persons fairly and equitably. This does not always imply equally (eg, triage).

Informed consent A process (not just a document/signature) that requires:

Disclosure: discussion of pertinent information (using medical interpreter, if needed)

Understanding: ability to comprehend

Capacity: ability to reason and make one’s own decisions (distinct from competence, a legal determination)

Voluntariness: freedom from coercion and manipulation

Patients must have an intelligent understanding of their diagnosis and the risks/benefits of proposed treatment and alternative options, including no treatment.

Patient must be informed that he or she can revoke written consent at any time, even orally.

Exceptions to informed consent (WIPE it away):

Waiver—patient explicitly waives the right of informed consent

Therapeutic Privilege—withholding information when disclosure would severely harm the patient or undermine informed decision-making capacity

Consent for minors A minor is generally any person < 18 years old. Parental consent laws in relation to healthcare vary by state. In general, parental consent should be obtained, but exceptions exist for emergency treatment (eg, blood transfusions) or if minor is legally emancipated (eg, married, self-supporting, or in the military).

Situations in which parental consent is usually not required:

Sex (contraception, STIs, pregnancy)

Rock and roll (emergency/trauma) Physicians should always encourage healthy minor-guardian communication.

Physician should seek a minor’s assent even if their consent is not required.

Physician must determine whether the patient is psychologically and legally capable of making a particular healthcare decision. Note that decisions made with capacity cannot be revoked simply if the patient later loses capacity. Intellectual disability alone (eg, Down syndrome, autism) is not an exclusion criterion for informed decision-making.

Capacity is determined by a physician for a specific healthcare-related decision (eg, to refuse medical care). Competency is determined by a judge and usually refers to more global categories of decision making (eg, legally unable to make any healthcare-related decision).

Components (think GIEMSA):

Decision is consistent with patient’s values and Goals

Patient is Informed (knows and understands)

Decision is not a result of altered Mental status (eg, delirium, psychosis, intoxication), Mood disorder

Patient is ≥ 18 years of Age or otherwise legally emancipated

Advance directives Instructions given by a patient in anticipation of the need for a medical decision. Details vary per state law.

Oral advance directive Incapacitated patient’s prior oral statements commonly used as guide. Problems arise from variance in interpretation. If patient was informed, directive was specific, patient made a choice, and decision was repeated over time to multiple people, then the oral directive is more valid.

Do not resuscitate DNR order prohibits cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Other resuscitative measures that may order follow (eg, feeding tube) are also typically avoided.

Confidentiality Confidentiality respects patient privacy and autonomy. If the patient is incapacitated or the situation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by professional judgment of patient’s best interest. The patient may voluntarily waive the right to confidentiality (eg, insurance company request). General principles for exceptions to confidentiality:

Potential physical harm to others is serious and imminent

Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible

Self-harm is likely

Steps can be taken to prevent harm

Examples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following (“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”):

Suicidal/homicidal patients.

Abuse (children, elderly, and/or prisoners).

Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow protect potential Victim from harm.

Epileptic patients and other impaired automobile drivers.

Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn public officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.

Patient is not adherent. Attempt to identify the reason for nonadherence and determine his/her willingness to change; do not coerce the patient into adhering and do not refer him/her to another physician.

A patient’s family member asks you not to disclose the results of a test if the prognosis is poor because the patient will be “unable to handle it.”

Attempt to identify why the family member believes such information would be detrimental to the patient’s condition. Explain that as long as the patient has decision-making capacity and does not indicate otherwise, communication of information concerning his/her care will not be withheld. However, if you believe the patient might seriously harm himself/herself or others if informed, then you may invoke therapeutic privilege and withhold the information.

Patient is suicidal. Assess the seriousness of the threat. If it is serious, suggest that the patient remain in the hospital voluntarily; patient can be hospitalized involuntarily if he/she refuses.

Discounted fee-for-Patient pays for each individual service at a discounted rate predetermined by providers and payers service (eg, PPOs).

Medicare and Medicaid—federal social healthcare programs that originated from amendments to the Social Security Act.

Medicare is available to patients ≥ 65 years old, < 65 with certain disabilities, and those with end-stage renal disease.

Medicaid is joint federal and state health assistance for people with limited income and/ or resources.

MedicarE is for Elderly. MedicaiD is for Destitute.

The 4 parts of Medicare:

Part A: HospitAl insurance, home hospice care

Part B: Basic medical bills (eg, doctor’s fees, diagnostic testing)

Part C: (parts A + B = Combo) delivered by approved private companies

Part D: Prescription Drugs

Hospice care Medical care focused on providing comfort and palliation instead of definitive cure. Available to patients on Medicare or Medicaid and in most private insurance plans whose life expectancy is < 6 months. During end-of-life care, priority is given to improving the patient’s comfort and relieving pain (often includes opioid, sedative, or anxiolytic medications). Facilitating comfort is prioritized over potential side effects (eg, respiratory depression). This prioritization of positive effects over negative effects is called the principle of double effect.

Common causes of death (US) by age

Safety culture Organizational environment in which everyone Event reporting systems collect data on errors for can freely bring up safety concerns without internal and external monitoring. fear of censure. Facilitates error identification.

Human factors design Forcing functions (those that prevent undesirable actions [eg, connecting feeding syringe to IV tubing]) are the most effective. Standardization improves process reliability (eg, clinical pathways, guidelines, checklists). Simplification reduces wasteful activities (eg, consolidating electronic medical records).

Deficient designs hinder workflow and lead to staff workarounds that bypass safety features (eg, patient ID barcodes affixed to computers due to unreadable wristbands).

PDSA cycle Process improvement model to test changes in real clinical setting. Impact on patients:

Swiss cheese model Focuses on systems and conditions rather than an individual’s error. The risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by differing layers and types of defenses. Patient harm can occur despite multiple safeguards when “the holes in the cheese line up.”

Types of medical May involve patient identification, diagnosis, monitoring, nosocomial infection, medications, errors procedures, devices, documentation, handoffs. Medical errors should be disclosed to patients, independent of immediate outcome (harmful or not).

“Symptoms, then, are in reality nothing but the cry from suffering organs.” “Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs.” “When every part of the machine is correctly adjusted and in perfect harmony, health will hold dominion over the human organism by laws as natural and immutable as the laws of gravity.” —Andrew T. Still

Skin, and Connective Tissue 445

In this section, we have divided the High-Yield Facts into the major Organ Systems. Within each Organ System are several subsections, including Embryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As you progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a “vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice for studying the organ systems by these subsections.

Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to congenital malformations.

Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.

When studying, stress clinically important material. For example, be familiar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy related to specific diseases (eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body (eg, sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.

The portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations. Hormones are the focus of many questions, so learn their sites of production and action as well as their regulatory mechanisms.

A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract) and endocrine glands.

Questions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must also know the clinical descriptions of these findings.

Given the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to review the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United States (eg, alcoholism, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications.

The examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and photographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.

Preparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, and important side effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother with drug dosages or trade names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer drugs on the market are also fair game.

“As for me, except for an occasional heart attack, I feel as young as I ever did.” “Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable.” —The Wizard of Oz “As the arteries grow hard, the heart grows soft.” —H. L. Mencken “Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold.” “Only from the heart can you touch the sky.” “It is not the size of the man but the size of his heart that matters.”

The cardiovascular system is one of the highest yield areas for the boards and, for some students, may be the most challenging. Focusing on understanding the mechanisms instead of memorizing the details can make a big difference, especially for this topic. Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and heart failure, MOA of drugs (particular physiology interactions) and their adverse effects, ECGs of heart blocks, the cardiac cycle, and the Starling curve are some of the more high-yield topics. Differentiating between systolic and diastolic dysfunction is also very important. Heart murmurs and maneuvers that affect these murmurs have also been high yield and may be asked in a multimedia format.

Septation of the chambers

Septum primum grows toward endocardial cushions, narrowing foramen primum. Foramen secundum forms in septum primum (foramen primum regresses). Septum secundum develops on the right side of septum primum, as foramen secundum maintains right-to-left shunt. Septum secundum expands and covers most of foramen secundum. The residual foramen is the foramen ovale. Remaining portion of septum primum forms the one-way valve of the foramen ovale.

6.

Septum primum closes against septum secundum, sealing the foramen ovale soon after birth because of  LA pressure and  RA pressure.

7.

Septum secundum and septum primum fuse during infancy/early childhood, forming the atrial septum.

Patent foramen ovale—caused by failure of septum primum and septum secundum to fuse after birth; most are left untreated. Can lead to paradoxical emboli (venous thromboemboli entering the systemic arterial circulation) as can occur in ASD.

Muscular interventricular septum forms. Opening is called interventricular foramen. Aorticopulmonary septum rotates and fuses with muscular ventricular septum to form membranous interventricular septum, closing interventricular foramen.

Growth of endocardial cushions separates atria from ventricles and contributes to both atrial septation and membranous portion of the interventricular septum.

Ventricular septal defect—most common congenital cardiac anomaly, usually occurs in membranous septum.

Primitive ventricle Trabeculated part of left and right ventricles

Primitive atrium Trabeculated part of left and right atria

Left horn of sinus venosus Coronary sinus

Right horn of sinus venosus Smooth part of right atrium (sinus venarum)

Anatomy of the heart

LA is the most posterior part of the heart A ; enlargement of the LA (eg, in mitral stenosis) can lead to compression of the esophagus (dysphagia) and/or the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, causing hoarseness (Ortner syndrome).

RV is the most anterior part of the heart and most commonly injured in trauma.

Key:

LAD and its branches supply anterior 2/3 of interventricular septum, anterolateral papillary muscle, and anterior surface of LV. Most commonly occluded.

PDA supplies AV node (dependent on dominance), posterior 1/3 of interventricular septum, posterior 2/3 walls of ventricles, and posteromedial papillary muscle.

RCA supplies SA node (blood supply independent of dominance). Infarct may cause nodal dysfunction (bradycardia or heart block). Right (acute) marginal artery supplies RV.

Dominance:

Right-dominant circulation (85%) = PDA arises from RCA.

Left-dominant circulation (8%) = PDA arises from LCX.

from both LCX and RCA. Coronary blood flow peaks in early diastole.

Force of contraction is proportional to end-diastolic length of cardiac muscle fiber (preload).

contractility with catecholamines, positive inotropes (eg, digoxin).

contractility with loss of functional myocardium (eg, MI), β-blockers (acutely), non-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers, dilated cardiomyopathy.

Capillaries have highest total cross-sectional area and lowest flow velocity. Pressure gradient drives flow from high pressure to low pressure. Arterioles account for most of TPR.

Phases—left ventricle: valve opening; period of highest O2 consumption

Heart sounds:

S1—mitral and tricuspid valve closure. Loudest at mitral area.

Aortic area: Systolic murmur

Pulmonic area:

Tricuspid area:

Mitral area (apex):

Crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur and soft S2 (ejection click may be present). LV >> aortic pressure during systole. Loudest at heart base; radiates to carotids. “Pulsus parvus et tardus”—pulses are weak with a delayed peak. Can lead to Syncope, Angina, and Dyspnea on exertion (SAD). Most commonly due to age-related calcification in older patients (> 60 years old) or in younger patients with early-onset calcification of bicuspid aortic valve.

Holosystolic, high-pitched “blowing murmur.” Mitral—loudest at apex and radiates toward axilla. MR is often due to ischemic heart disease (post-MI), MVP, LV dilatation. Tricuspid—loudest at tricuspid area. TR commonly caused by RV dilatation. Rheumatic fever and infective endocarditis can cause either MR or TR.

Late systolic crescendo murmur with midsystolic click (MC) due to sudden tensing of chordae tendineae as mitral leaflets prolapse into the LA (Chordae cause Crescendo with Click). Most frequent valvular lesion. Best heard over apex. Loudest just before S2. Usually benign. Can predispose to infective endocarditis. Can be caused by myxomatous degeneration (1° or 2° to connective tissue disease such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), rheumatic fever (particularly in developing countries), chordae rupture.

High-pitched “blowing” early diastolic decrescendo murmur. Best heard at base (aortic root dilation) or left sternal border (valvular disease). Long diastolic murmur, hyperdynamic pulse, and head bobbing when severe and chronic. Wide pulse pressure. Causes include Bicuspid aortic valve, Endocarditis, Aortic root dilation, Rheumatic fever (BEAR). Progresses to left HF.

Follows opening snap (OS; due to abrupt halt in leaflet motion in diastole, after rapid opening due to fusion at leaflet tips). Delayed rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur ( interval between S2 and OS correlates with  severity). LA >> LV pressure during diastole.

Often a late (and highly specific) sequela of rheumatic fever. Chronic MS can result in pulmonary congestion/hypertension and LA dilation  atrial fibrillation and Ortner syndrome.

Patent ductus arteriosus Continuous machine-like murmur. Best heard at left infraclavicular area. Loudest at S2. Often due to congenital rubella or prematurity.

“PDAs (Public Displays of Affection) are continuously annoying.”

Phase 0 = rapid upstroke and depolarization— voltage-gated Na+ channels open.

Phase 1 = initial repolarization—inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels begin to open.

Phase 2 = plateau—Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels balances K+ efflux. Ca2+ influx triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and myocyte contraction.

Phase 3 = rapid repolarization—massive K+ efflux due to opening of voltage-gated slow delayed-rectifier K+ channels and closure of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Phase 4 = resting potential—high K+ permeability through K+ channels.

In contrast to skeletal muscle:

Cardiac muscle action potential has a plateau due to Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux.

Cardiac muscle contraction requires Ca2+ influx from ECF to induce Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release).

Cardiac myocytes are electrically coupled to each other by gap junctions.

Occurs in all cardiac myocytes except for those in the SA and AV nodes.

Occurs in the SA and AV nodes. Key differences from the ventricular action potential include:

Phase 0 = upstroke—opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels are permanently inactivated because of the less negative resting potential of these cells. Results in a slow conduction velocity that is used by the AV node to prolong transmission from the atria to ventricles.

Phases 1 and 2 are absent.

Phase 3 = repolarization—inactivation of the Ca2+ channels and  activation of K+ channels  K+ efflux.

Phase 4 = slow spontaneous diastolic depolarization due to If (“funny current”). If channels responsible for a slow, mixed Na+/K+ inward current; different from INa in phase 0 of ventricular action potential. Accounts for automaticity of SA and AV nodes. The slope of phase 4 in the SA node determines HR. ACh/adenosine  the rate of diastolic depolarization and  HR, while catecholamines • depolarization and  HR.

Electrocardiogram Conduction pathway: SA node  atria  bundle of His  right and left bundle branches  Purkinje fibers left bundle branch divides into left anterior and posterior fascicles.

SA node—located at junction of RA and SVC; “pacemaker” inherent dominance with slow phase of upstroke.

AV node—located in posteroinferior part of interatrial septum. Blood supply usually from RCA. 100-msec delay allows time for ventricular filling.

Pacemaker rates: SA > AV > bundle of His/ Purkinje/ventricles.

Speed of conduction: His-Purkinje > Atria > Ventricles > AV node. He Parks At Ventura Avenue.

P wave—atrial depolarization.

PR interval—time from start of atrial depolarization to start of ventricular depolarization (normally 120-200 msec).

QRS complex—ventricular depolarization (normally < 100 msec).

QT interval—ventricular depolarization, mechanical contraction of the ventricles, ventricular repolarization.

T wave—ventricular repolarization. T-wave inversion may indicate ischemia or recent MI. J point—junction between end of QRS complex and start of ST segment. ST segment—isoelectric, ventricles depolarized. U wave—prominent in hypokalemia (think hyp“U”kalemia), bradycardia.

The endocrine system comprises widely distributed organs that work in a highly integrated manner to orchestrate a state of hormonal equilibrium within the body. Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction, or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating disease manifestations with diagnosis and management. Take time to learn the multisystem connections.

Thyroid diverticulum arises from floor of primitive pharynx and descends into neck. Connected to tongue by thyroglossal duct, which normally disappears but may persist as cysts or the pyramidal lobe of thyroid. Foramen cecum is normal remnant of thyroglossal duct.

Most common ectopic thyroid tissue site is the tongue (lingual thyroid). Removal may result in hypothyroidism if it is the only thyroid tissue present.

Thyroglossal duct cyst A presents as an anterior midline neck mass that moves with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue (vs persistent cervical sinus leading to pharyngeal cleft cyst in lateral neck).

Thyroid follicular cells derived from endoderm.

Also called somatotropin. Secreted by anterior pituitary.

Stimulates linear growth and muscle mass through IGF-1 (somatomedin C) secretion by liver.  insulin resistance (diabetogenic).

Released in pulses in response to growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH).

Secretion  during exercise, deep sleep, puberty, hypoglycemia, CKD.

Secretion  by glucose, somatostatin, somatomedin (regulatory molecule secreted by liver in response to GH acting on target tissues).

Excess secretion of GH (eg, pituitary adenoma) may cause acromegaly (adults) or gigantism (children). Treatment: somatostatin analogs (eg, octreotide) or surgery.

ADH level is  in central diabetes insipidus (DI), normal or  in nephrogenic DI.

Nephrogenic DI can be caused by mutation in V2-receptor.

Thyroid hormones Thyroid produces triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), iodine-containing hormones that control the body’s metabolic rate.

soUrce Follicles of thyroid. 5′-deiodinase converts T4 (the major thyroid product) to T3 in peripheral tissue (5, 4, 3). Peripheral conversion is inhibited by glucocorticoids, β-blockers, and propylthiouracil (PTU). Reverse T3 (rT3) is a metabolically inactive byproduct of the peripheral conversion of T4 and its production is increased by growth hormone and glucocorticoids. Functions of thyroid peroxidase include oxidation, organification of iodine, and coupling of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Inhibited by PTU and methimazole. DIT + DIT = T4. DIT + MIT = T3. Wolff-Chaikoff effect—excess iodine temporarily turns off thyroid peroxidase  T3/T4 production (protective autoregulatory effect).

“A good set of bowels is worth more to a man than any quantity of brains.” “Man should strive to have his intestines relaxed all the days of his life.” “All right, let’s not panic. I’ll make the money by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one.”

When studying the gastrointestinal system, be sure to understand the normal embryology, anatomy, and physiology and how it is affected in the various pathologic diseases. Study not only what a disease entails, but also its specific findings, so that you can differentiate between two similar diseases. For example, what specifically makes ulcerative colitis different than Crohn disease? Also, it is important to understand bile metabolism and which lab values increase or decrease depending on the disease process. Be comfortable with basic interpretation of abdominal x-rays, CT scans, and endoscopic images.

Ventral wall defects Developmental defects due to failure of rostral fold closure (eg, sternal defects [ectopia cordis]), lateral fold closure (eg, omphalocele, gastroschisis), or caudal fold closure (eg, bladder exstrophy).

Congenital umbilical Failure of umbilical ring to close after physiologic herniation of the midgut. Small defects usually hernia close spontaneously.

Tracheoesophageal Esophageal atresia (EA) with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is the most common (85%) anomalies and often presents as polyhydramnios in utero (due to inability of fetus to swallow amniotic fluid). Neonates drool, choke, and vomit with first feeding. TEFs allow air to enter stomach (visible on CXR). Cyanosis is 2° to laryngospasm (to avoid reflux-related aspiration). Clinical test: failure to pass nasogastric tube into stomach. In H-type, the fistula resembles the letter H. In pure EA, CXR shows gasless abdomen.

Intestinal atresia Presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension within first 1–2 days of life. Duodenal atresia—failure to recanalize. Abdominal x-ray A shows “double bubble” (dilated stomach, proximal duodenum). Associated with Down syndrome. Jejunal and ileal atresia—disruption of mesenteric vessels (typically SMA)  ischemic necrosis of fetal intestine  segmental resorption: bowel becomes discontinuous. X-ray shows dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.

Most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants (1:600). Palpable olive-shaped mass in epigastric region, visible peristaltic waves, and nonbilious projectile vomiting at ∼ 2–6 weeks old. More common in firstborn males; associated with exposure to macrolides.

Results in hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (2° to vomiting of gastric acid and subsequent volume contraction).

Ultrasound shows thickened and lengthened pylorus A .

Treatment: surgical incision of pyloric muscles (pyloromyotomy).

Retroperitoneal Retroperitoneal structures A are posterior to structures (and outside of) the peritoneal cavity. Injuries to retroperitoneal structures can cause blood or gas accumulation in retroperitoneal space.

Arteries supplying GI structures are single and branch anteriorly.

Arteries supplying non-GI structures are paired and branch laterally and posteriorly.

Two areas of the colon have dual blood supply from distal arterial branches (“watershed regions”)  susceptible in colonic ischemia:

Rectosigmoid junction—the last sigmoid arterial branch from the IMA and superior rectal artery

Nutcracker syndrome—compression of left renal vein between superior mesenteric artery and aorta. Characterized by abdominal (flank) pain and gross hematuria (from rupture of thin-walled renal varicosities).

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome— characterized by intermittent intestinal obstruction symptoms (primarily postprandial pain) when SMA and aorta compress transverse (third) portion of duodenum. Typically occurs in conditions associated with diminished mesenteric fat (eg, low body weight/malnutrition).

Celiac trunk Branches of celiac trunk: common hepatic, splenic, and left gastric. These constitute the main blood supply of the foregut. Strong anastomoses exist between:

Pathologic blood in portal HTN Flow through TIPS, re-establishing normal fow direction

Varicesof gut, butt, and caput (medusae) are commonly seen with portal hypertension.

Treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) between the portal vein and hepatic vein relieves portal hypertension by shunting blood to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver. TIPS can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy due to  clearance of ammonia from shunting.

Pectinate line Also called dentate line. Formed where endoderm (hindgut) meets ectoderm.

Above pectinate line: internal hemorrhoids, adenocarcinoma.

Internal hemorrhoids receive visceral innervation and are therefore not painful.

Below pectinate line: external hemorrhoids, anal fissures, squamous cell carcinoma.

External hemorrhoids receive somatic innervation (inferior rectal branch of pudendal nerve) and are therefore painful if thrombosed.

Anal fissure—tear in anal mucosa below Pectinate line. Pain while Pooping; blood on toilet Paper. Located Posteriorly because this area is Poorly Perfused. Innervated by Pudendal nerve. Associated with low-fiber diets and constipation.

The functional unit of the liver is made up of hexagonally arranged lobules surrounding the central vein with portal triads on the edges (consisting of a portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, as well as lymphatics) A .

Hernias Protrusion of peritoneum through an opening, usually at a site of weakness. Contents may be at risk for incarceration (not reducible back into abdomen/pelvis) and strangulation (ischemia and necrosis). Complicated hernias can present with tenderness, erythema, fever.

Direct inguinal hernia Protrudes through inguinal (Hesselbach) triangle. Bulges directly through parietal peritoneum medial to the inferior epigastric vessels but lateral to the rectus abdominis. Goes through external (superficial) inguinal ring only. Covered by external spermatic fascia. Usually occurs in older men due to acquired weakness of transversalis fascia. MDs don’t LIe: Medial to inferior epigastric vessels = Direct hernia. Lateral to inferior epigastric vessels = Indirect hernia.

Femoral hernia Protrudes below inguinal ligament through femoral canal below and lateral to pubic tubercle. More common in females, but overall inguinal hernias are the most common. More likely to present with incarceration or strangulation (vs inguinal hernia).

Abdominal structures enter the thorax A ; may occur due to congenital defect of pleuroperitoneal membrane or from trauma. Commonly occurs on left side due to relative protection of right hemidiaphragm by liver. Most commonly a hiatal hernia, in which stomach herniates upward through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.

Sliding hiatal hernia—gastroesophageal junction is displaced upward as gastric cardia slides into hiatus; “hourglass stomach.” Most gastric fundus common type. Associated with GERD.

Paraesophageal hiatal hernia— gastroesophageal junction is usually normal but gastric fundus protrudes into the thorax.

Goes through the internal (deep) inguinal ring, external (superficial) inguinal ring, and into the groin. Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric vessels. Caused by failure of processus vaginalis to close (can form hydrocele). May be noticed in infants or discovered in adulthood. Much more common in males

Think of IgA, the Intra-gut Antibody

Unencapsulated lymphoid tissue A found in lamina propria and submucosa of ileum. Contain specialized M cells that sample and present antigens to immune cells.

B cells stimulated in germinal centers of Peyer patches differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma cells, which ultimately reside in lamina propria. IgA receives protective secretory component and is then transported across the epithelium to the gut to deal with intraluminal antigen.

Bilirubin Heme is metabolized by heme oxygenase to biliverdin, which is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is removed from blood by liver, conjugated with glucuronate, and excreted in bile. Direct bilirubin: conjugated with glucuronic acid; water soluble (dissolves in water). Indirect bilirubin: unconjugated; water insoluble.

Excreted in urine as urobilin (˜ yellow color)

Excreted in feces as stercobilin (˜ brown color of stool)

This chapter provides information you will need to understand certain anatomical dysfunctions, rheumatic diseases, and dermatologic conditions. Be able to interpret 3D anatomy in the context of radiologic imaging. For the rheumatic diseases, create instructional cases or personas that include the most likely presentation and symptoms: risk factors, gender, important markers (eg, autoantibodies), and other epidemiologic factors. Doing so will allow you to answer the higher order questions that are likely to be asked on the exam.

Motoneuron action T-tubules are extensions of plasma membrane in contact with the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing potential to muscle for coordinated contraction of striated muscles. contraction

Action potential opens presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, inducing acetylcholine (ACh) release. Postsynaptic ACh binding leads to muscle cell depolarization at the motor end plate. Depolarization travels over the entire muscle cell and deep into the muscle via the T-tubules. Membrane depolarization induces conformational changes in the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and its mechanically coupled ryanodine receptor (RR) • Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. Tropomyosin is blocking myosin-binding sites on the actin filament. Released Ca2+ binds to troponin C (TnC), shifting tropomyosin to expose the myosin-binding sites. The myosin head binds strongly to actin, forming a crossbridge. Pi is then released, initiating the power stroke. During the power stroke, force is produced as myosin pulls on the thin filament

A . Muscle shortening occurs, with shortening of H and I bands and between Z lines (HIZ shrinkage). The A band remains the same length (A band is Always the same length). ADP is released at the end of the power stroke. Binding of new ATP molecule causes detachment of myosin head from actin filament. Ca2+ is resequestered. ATP hydrolysis into ADP and Pi results in myosin head returning to high-energy position (cocked). The myosin head can bind to a new site on actin to form a crossbridge if Ca2+ remains available.

Reaction of neuronal cell body to axonal injury. Changes reflect  protein synthesis in effort to repair the damaged axon. Characterized by:

Displacement of the nucleus to the periphery

Dispersion of Nissl substance throughout cytoplasm Wallerian degeneration—disintegration of the axon and myelin sheath distal to site of axonal injury with macrophages removing debris.

Proximal to the injury, the axon retracts, and the cell body sprouts new protrusions that grow toward other neurons for potential reinnervation. Serves as a preparation for axonal regeneration and functional recovery.

Direct (excitatory) pathway—SNc input to the striatum via the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway releases GABA, which inhibits GABA release from the GPi, disinhibiting the Thalamus via the GPi (• motion).

Indirect (inhibitory) pathway—SNc input to the striatum via the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway releases GABA that disinhibits STN via GPe inhibition, and STN stimulates GPi to inhibit the thalamus (• motion).

Dopamine binds to D1, stimulating the excitatory pathway, and to D2, inhibiting the inhibitory pathway  motion.

Irreversible neuronal injury begins after 5 minutes of hypoxia. Most vulnerable: hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), watershed areas (“vulnerable hippos need pure water”). Stroke imaging: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (before tPA can be given). CT detects ischemic changes in 6–24 hr. Diffusion-weighted MRI can detect ischemia within 3–30 min.

Acute blockage of vessels  disruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemia  infarction necrosis. 3 types:

Thrombotic—due to a clot forming directly at site of infarction (commonly the MCA A ), usually over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.

Embolic—embolus from another part of the body obstructs vessel. Can affect multiple vascular territories. Examples: atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, DVT with patent foramen ovale, infective endocarditis.

Hypoxic—due to hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Common during cardiovascular surgeries, tends to affect watershed areas.

Treatment: tPA (if within 3–4.5 hr of onset and no hemorrhage/risk of hemorrhage) and/or thrombectomy (if large artery occlusion). Reduce risk with medical therapy (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel); optimum control of blood pressure, blood sugars, lipids; smoking cessation; and treat conditions that  risk (eg, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis).

Uveitis Inflammation of uvea; specific name based on location within affected eye. Anterior uveitis: iritis; posterior uveitis: choroiditis and/or retinitis. May have hypopyon (accumulation of pus in anterior chamber A ) or conjunctival redness. Associated with systemic inflammatory disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, HLA-B27–associated conditions).

Degeneration of macula (central area of retina). Causes distortion (metamorphopsia) and eventual loss of central vision (scotomas).

Dry (nonexudative, > 80%)—Deposition of yellowish extracellular material (“Drusen”) in between Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium A with gradual  in vision. Prevent progression with multivitamin and antioxidant supplements.

Leukocoria Loss (whitening) of the red reflex. Important causes in children include retinoblastoma A , congenital cataract, toxocariasis.

Miosis Constriction, parasympathetic: 1st neuron: Edinger-Westphal nucleus to ciliary ganglion via CN III 2nd neuron: short ciliary nerves to sphincter pupillae muscles Short ciliary nerves shorten the pupil diameter.

Pupillary light reflex Light in either retina sends a signal via CN II to pretectal nuclei (dashed lines in image) in midbrain that activates bilateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei; pupils constrict bilaterally (direct and consensual reflex). Result: illumination of 1 eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction.

Mydriasis Dilation, sympathetic: 1st neuron: hypothalamus to ciliospinal center of Budge (C8–T2) 2nd neuron: exit at T1 to superior cervical ganglion (travels along cervical sympathetic chain near lung apex, subclavian vessels) 3rd neuron: plexus along internal carotid, through cavernous sinus; enters orbit as long ciliary nerve to pupillary dilator muscles. Sympathetic fibers also innervate smooth muscle of eyelids (minor retractors) and sweat glands of forehead and face.

Long ciliary nerves make the pupil diameter longer.

Marcus Gunn pupil Also called relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). When the light shines into a normal eye, constriction of the ipsilateral (direct reflex) and contralateral eye (consensual reflex) is observed. When the light is then swung to the affected eye, both pupils dilate instead of constrict due to impaired conduction of light signal along the injured optic nerve. Associated with optic neuritis, early multiple sclerosis.

Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF): pair of tracts that allows for crosstalk between CN VI and CN III nuclei. Coordinates both eyes to move in same horizontal direction. Highly myelinated (must communicate quickly so eyes move at same time). Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral (latter classically seen in multiple sclerosis, stroke).

Lesion in MLF = internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), a conjugate horizontal gaze palsy. Lack of communication such that when CN VI nucleus activates ipsilateral lateral rectus, contralateral CN III nucleus does not stimulate medial rectus to contract. Abducting eye displays nystagmus (CN VI overfires to stimulate CN III). Convergence normal.

MLF in MS.

When looking left, the left nucleus of CN VI fires, which contracts the left lateral rectus and stimulates the contralateral (right) nucleus of CN III via the right MLF to contract the right medial rectus.

Directional term (eg, right INO, left INO) refers to the eye that is unable to adduct.

This chapter encompasses overlapping areas in psychiatry, psychology, sociology, and psychopharmacology. High-yield topics include schizophrenia, mood disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, somatic symptom disorders, substance abuse, and antipsychotic agents. Know the DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing common psychiatric disorders.

Operant conditioning Learning in which a particular action is elicited because it produces a punishment or reward. Usually elicits voluntary responses.

Reinforcement Target behavior (response) is followed by desired Skinner operant conditioning quadrants: reward (positive reinforcement) or removal of aversive stimulus (negative reinforcement).

Punishment Repeated application of aversive stimulus (positive punishment) or removal of desired reward (negative punishment) to extinguish unwanted behavior.

Extinction Discontinuation of reinforcement (positive or negative) eventually eliminates behavior. Can occur in operant or classical conditioning.

Transference Patient projects feelings about formative or other important persons onto physician (eg, psychiatrist is seen as parent).

Countertransference Doctor projects feelings about formative or other important persons onto patient (eg, patient reminds physician of younger sibling).

Ego defenses Thoughts and behaviors (voluntary or involuntary) used to resolve conflict and prevent undesirable feelings (eg, anxiety, depression).

Denial Avoiding the awareness of some painful reality. A patient with cancer plans a full-time work schedule despite being warned of significant fatigue during chemotherapy.

Mature adults wear a SASH.

Lack of basic trust

Reactive attachment disorder (infant withdrawn/unresponsive to comfort)

Disinhibited social engagement (child indiscriminately attaches to strangers)

Child neglect Failure to provide a child with adequate food, shelter, supervision, education, and/or affection. Most common form of child maltreatment. Signs: poor hygiene, malnutrition, withdrawal, impaired social/emotional development, failure to thrive. As with child abuse, suspected child neglect must be reported to local child protective services.

Onset before age 12. ≥ 6 months of limited attention span and/or poor impulse control. Characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention in ≥ 2 settings (eg, school, home, places of worship). Normal intelligence, but commonly coexists with difficulties in school. Often persists into adulthood. Commonly coexists with oppositional defiant disorder. Treatment: stimulants (eg, methylphenidate) +/– behavioral therapy; alternatives include atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine.

Conduct disorder Repetitive, pervasive behavior violating societal norms or the basic rights of others (eg, aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, theft). After age 18, often reclassified as antisocial personality disorder. Treatment: psychotherapy (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]).

Intellectual disability Global cognitive deficits (vs specific learning disorder) that affect reasoning, memory, abstract thinking, judgment, language, learning. Adaptive functioning is impaired, leading to major difficulties with education, employment, communication, socialization, independence. Treatment: psychotherapy, occupational therapy, special education.

Oppositional defiant Enduring pattern of anger and irritability with argumentative, vindictive, and defiant behavior disorder toward authority figures. Treatment: psychotherapy (eg, CBT).

Selective mutism Onset before age 5. Anxiety disorder lasting ≥ 1 month involving refraining from speech in certain situations despite speaking in other, usually more comfortable situations. Development (eg, speech and language) not typically impaired. Interferes with social, academic, and occupational tasks. Commonly coexists with social anxiety disorder. Treatment: behavioral, family, and play therapy; SSRIs.

Tourette syndrome Onset before age 18. Sudden, Sudden, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal tics that persist for > 1 year. Coprolalia (involuntary obscene speech) found in some patients. Associated with OCD and ADHD. Treatment: psychoeducation, behavioral therapy. For intractable and distressing tics, high-potency antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, fluphenazine), tetrabenazine, α2-agonists (eg, guanfacine, clonidine), or atypical antipsychotics.

Orientation Patients’ ability to know the date and time, where they are, and who they are (order of loss: time  place  person). Common causes of loss of orientation: alcohol, drugs, fluid/electrolyte imbalance, head trauma, hypoglycemia, infection, nutritional deficiencies, hypoxia.

Depersonalization/ Persistent feelings of detachment or estrangement from one’s own body, thoughts, perceptions, derealization and actions (depersonalization) or one’s environment (derealization). Intact reality testing (vs disorder psychosis).

Delirium “Waxing and waning” level of consciousness with acute onset,  attention span,  level of arousal. Characterized by disorganized thinking, hallucinations (often visual), misperceptions (eg, illusions), disturbance in sleep-wake cycle, cognitive dysfunction, agitation. Reversible. Usually 2° to other identifiable illness (eg, CNS disease, infection, trauma, substance abuse/ withdrawal, metabolic/electrolyte disturbances, hemorrhage, urinary/fecal retention), or medications (eg, anticholinergics), especially in the elderly. Most common presentation of altered mental status in inpatient setting, especially in the ICU or during prolonged hospital stays. EEG may show diffuse background rhythm slowing.

Delirium = changes in sensorium.

Treatment: identification and management of underlying condition. Orientation protocols (eg, keeping a clock or calendar nearby),  sleep disturbances, and  cognitive stimulation to manage symptoms. Antipsychotics as needed. Avoid unnecessary restraints and drugs that may worsen delirium (eg, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids).

Psychosis Distorted perception of reality characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and/or disorganized thought/speech. Can occur in patients with medical illness, psychiatric illness, or both.

Delusions False, fixed, idiosyncratic beliefs that persist despite evidence to the contrary and are not typical of a patient’s culture or religion (eg, a patient who believes that others are reading his thoughts). Types include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed, and unspecified.

Disorganized thought Speech may be incoherent (“word salad”), tangential, or derailed (“loose associations”).

Hallucinations Perceptions in the absence of external stimuli (eg, seeing a light that is not actually present). Contrast with misperceptions (eg, illusions) of real external stimuli. Types include:

Auditory—more commonly due to psychiatric illness (eg, schizophrenia) than medical illness.

Visual—more commonly due to medical illness (eg, drug intoxication, delirium) than psychiatric illness.

Tactile—common in alcohol withdrawal and stimulant use (eg, “cocaine crawlies,” a type of delusional parasitosis).

Olfactory—often occur as an aura of temporal lobe epilepsy (eg, burning rubber) and in brain tumors.

Gustatory—rare, but seen in epilepsy.

Hypnagogic—occurs while going to sleep. Sometimes seen in narcolepsy.

Hypnopompic—occurs while waking from sleep (“get pomped up in the morning”). Sometimes seen in narcolepsy.

Schizophrenia Chronic illness causing profound functional impairment. Symptom categories include:

Positive—hallucinations, delusions, unusual thought processes, disorganized speech, bizarre behavior

Negative—flat or blunted affect, apathy, anhedonia, alogia, social withdrawal

Cognitive—reduced ability to understand or make plans, diminished working memory, inattention

Daily functioning, including socialization, may be impacted by the pathological, fixed belief but is otherwise unaffected. Can be shared by individuals in close relationships (folie à deux).

Schizotypal personality Cluster A personality disorder that also falls on the schizophrenia spectrum. May include brief disorder psychotic episodes (eg, delusions) that are less frequent and severe than in schizophrenia.

Mood disorder Characterized by an abnormal range of moods or internal emotional states and loss of control over them. Severity of moods causes distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning. Includes major depressive, bipolar, dysthymic, and cyclothymic disorders. Episodic superimposed psychotic features (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior) may be present.

Manic episode Distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and  activity or energy lasting ≥ 1 week. Diagnosis requires hospitalization or marked functional impairment with ≥ 3 of the following (manics DIG FAST):

Distractibility • Flight of ideas—racing thoughts

Impulsivity/Indiscretion—seeks pleasure •  goal-directed Activity/psychomotor without regard to consequences (hedonistic) Agitation

Hypomanic episode Similar to a manic episode except mood disturbance is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social and/or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. Abnormally  activity or energy usually present. No psychotic features. Lasts ≥ 4 consecutive days.

length of time). Bipolar II—a hypomanic and a depressive episode (no history of manic episodes). Patient’s mood and functioning usually normalize between episodes. Use of antidepressants can destabilize mood. High suicide risk. Treatment: mood stabilizers (eg, lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), atypical antipsychotics.

Cyclothymic disorder—milder form of bipolar disorder fluctuating between mild depressive and hypomanic symptoms. Must last ≥ 2 years with symptoms present at least half of the time, with any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.

Recurrent episodes lasting ≥ 2 weeks characterized by ≥ 5 of 9 diagnostic symptoms (must include depressed mood or anhedonia) (DIGS SPACE):

Guilt or feelings of worthlessness

Screen for previous manic or hypomanic episodes to rule out bipolar disorder. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. Also SNRIs, mirtazapine, bupropion, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Persistent depressive Often milder than MDD; ≥ 2 depressive symptoms lasting ≥ 2 years (≥ 1 year in children), with any disorder (dysthymia) remission lasting ≤ 2 months.

MDD with seasonal Formerly called seasonal affective disorder. Major depressive episodes occurring only during a pattern particular season (usually winter) in ≥ 2 consecutive years and in most years across a lifetime. Atypical symptoms common.

Depression with atypical features

Characterized by mood reactivity (transient improvement in response to a positive event), hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms and legs), long-standing interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Most common subtype of depression. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line. MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective but not first line because of their risk profile.

MDD with peripartum 10–15% incidence rate. Formerly called postpartum depression. Meets MDD criteria with onset no onset later than 1 year after delivery. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line.

Postpartum psychosis 0.1–0.2% incidence rate. Characterized by mood-congruent delusions, hallucinations, and thoughts of harming the baby or self. Risk factors include first pregnancy, family history, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, recent medication change. Treatment: hospitalization and initiation of atypical antipsychotic; if insufficient, ECT may be used.

Grief The five stages of grief per the Kübler-Ross model are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (may occur in any order). Other normal grief symptoms include shock, guilt, sadness, anxiety, yearning, and somatic symptoms that usually occur in waves. Simple hallucinations of the deceased person are common (eg, hearing the deceased speaking). Any thoughts of dying are limited to joining the deceased (vs complicated grief). Duration varies widely; usually resolves within 6–12 months. Persistent complex bereavement disorder involves obsessive preoccupation with the deceased and causes functional impairment, lasting at least 12 months (6 months in children). Can also meet criteria for major depressive episode.

SAD PERSONS are more likely to complete suicide.

Most common method in US is firearms; access to guns  risk of suicide completion.

Women try more often; men complete more often.

Other risk factors include recent psychiatric hospitalization and family history of completed suicide.

Anxiety disorders Inappropriate experiences of fear/worry and their physical manifestations incongruent with the magnitude of the stressors. Symptoms are not attributable to another psychiatric disorder, medical condition (eg, hyperthyroidism), or substance abuse. Includes panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.

Phobias Severe, persistent (≥ 6 months) fear or anxiety due to presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation. Person often recognizes fear is excessive. Treatment: CBT with exposure therapy.

Social anxiety disorder—exaggerated fear of embarrassment in social situations (eg, public speaking, using public restrooms). Treatment: CBT, SSRIs, venlafaxine. For performance type (eg, anxiety restricted to public speaking), use β-blockers or benzodiazepines as needed.

Agoraphobia—irrational fear/anxiety while facing or anticipating ≥ 2 specific situations (eg, open/ closed spaces, lines, crowds, public transport). If severe, patients may refuse to leave their homes. Associated with panic disorder. Treatment: CBT, SSRIs.

Trichotillomania Compulsively pulling out one’s hair. Causes significant distress and persists despite attempts to stop. Presents with areas of thinning hair or baldness on any area of the body, most commonly the scalp

A . Incidence highest in childhood but spans all ages. Treatment: psychotherapy.

Adjustment disorder Emotional or behavioral symptoms (eg, anxiety, outbursts) that occur within 3 months of an identifiable psychosocial stressor (eg, divorce, illness) lasting < 6 months once the stressor has ended. If symptoms persist > 6 months after stressor ends, it is GAD. Symptoms do not meet criteria for MDD. Treatment: CBT is first line; antidepressants and anxiolytics may be considered.

Schizoid Voluntary social withdrawal (Aloof), limited emotional expression, content with social isolation (vs avoidant).

Factitious disorders Symptoms are intentional, motivation is unconscious. Patient consciously creates physical and/or psychological symptoms in order to assume “sick role” and to get medical attention and sympathy (1° [internal] gain).

Conversion disorder Also called functional neurologic symptom disorder. Loss of sensory or motor function (eg, paralysis, blindness, mutism), often following an acute stressor; patient may be aware of but indifferent toward symptoms (la belle indifférence); more common in females, adolescents, and young adults.

Illness anxiety Preoccupation with acquiring or having a serious illness, often despite medical evaluation and disorder reassurance; minimal to no somatic symptoms.

Bulimia nervosa Recurring episodes of binge eating with compensatory purging behaviors at least weekly over the last 3 months. BMI often normal or slightly overweight (vs anorexia). Associated with parotid gland hypertrophy (may see • serum amylase), enamel erosion, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, electrolyte disturbances (eg,  K+ , • Cl−), metabolic alkalosis, dorsal hand calluses from induced vomiting (Russell sign). Treatment: psychotherapy, nutritional rehabilitation, antidepressants (eg, SSRIs). Bupropion is contraindicated due to seizure risk.

Sleep terror disorder Periods of inconsolable terror with screaming in the middle of the night. Most common in children. Occurs during slow-wave/deep (stage N3) non-REM sleep with no memory of the arousal episode, as opposed to nightmares that occur during REM sleep (remembering a scary dream). Triggers include emotional stress, fever, and lack of sleep. Usually self limited.

Enuresis Nighttime urinary incontinence ≥ 2 times/week for ≥ 3 months in person > 5 years old. First-line treatment: behavioral modification (eg, scheduled voids, nighttime fluid restriction) and positive reinforcement. For refractory cases: bedwetting alarm, oral desmopressin (ADH analog; preferred over imipramine due to fewer side effects).

Narcolepsy Excessive daytime sleepiness (despite awakening well-rested) with recurrent episodes of rapid-onset, overwhelming sleepiness ≥ 3 times/week for the last 3 months. Due to • orexin (hypocretin) production in lateral hypothalamus and dysregulated sleep-wake cycles. Associated with:

Hypnagogic (just before going to sleep) or hypnopompic (just before awakening; get pomped up in the morning) hallucinations.

Nocturnal and narcoleptic sleep episodes that start with REM sleep (sleep paralysis).

Cataplexy (loss of all muscle tone following strong emotional stimulus, such as laughter).

Treatment: good sleep hygiene (scheduled naps, regular sleep schedule), daytime stimulants (eg, amphetamines, modafinil) and/or nighttime sodium oxybate (GHB).

Stages of change in overcoming addiction

Maladaptive pattern of substance use involving ≥ 2 of the following in the past year:

Intense, distracting cravings

Using more, or longer, than intended

Persistent desire but inability to cut down

Time-consuming substance acquisition, use, or recovery

Complications: vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, testicular atrophy. Treatment: naltrexone (reduces cravings), acamprosate, disulfiram (to condition the patient to abstain from alcohol use). Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous are helpful in sustaining abstinence and supporting patient and family.

Wernicke-Korsakoff Results from vitamin B1 deficiency. Symptoms can be precipitated by administering dextrose syndrome before vitamin B1. Triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia (Wernicke encephalopathy). May progress to irreversible memory loss, confabulation, personality change (Korsakoff syndrome). Treatment: IV vitamin B1 (before dextrose).

Behavioral therapy Teaches patients how to identify and change maladaptive behaviors or reactions to stimuli. Examples include systematic desensitization for treatment of phobia.

Cognitive behavioral Teaches patients to recognize distortions in their thought processes, develop constructive coping therapy skills, and • maladaptive coping behaviors • greater emotional control and tolerance of distress. Examples include recognizing triggers for alcohol consumption.

“But I know all about love already. I know precious little still about kidneys.” —Aldous Huxley, Antic Hay “This too shall pass. Just like a kidney stone.” “I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.”

Being able to understand and apply renal physiology will be critical for the exam. Important topics include electrolyte disorders, acid-base derangements, glomerular disorders (including histopathology), acute and chronic kidney disease, urine casts, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and AT-II receptor blockers. Renal anomalies associated with various congenital defects are also high-yield associations to think about when evaluating pediatric vignettes.

Kidney embryology Pronephros—week 4; then degenerates. Mesonephros—functions as interim kidney for 1st trimester; later contributes to male genital system. Metanephros—permanent; first appears in 5th week of gestation; nephrogenesis continues through weeks 32–36 of gestation.

Ureteric bud (metanephric diverticulum)— derived from caudal end of mesonephric duct; gives rise to ureter, pelvises, calyces, collecting ducts; fully canalized by 10th week

Metanephric mesenchyme (ie, metanephric blastema)—ureteric bud interacts with this tissue; interaction induces differentiation and formation of glomerulus through to distal convoluted tubule (DCT)

Aberrant interaction between these 2 tissues may result in several congenital malformations of the kidney (eg, renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidney)

Ureteropelvic junction—last to canalize  congenital obstruction. Most common cause of prenatal hydronephrosis. Detected by prenatal ultrasound.

Oligohydramnios  compression of developing fetus  limb deformities, facial anomalies (eg, low-set ears and retrognathia A , flattened nose), compression of chest and lack of amniotic fluid aspiration into fetal lungs  pulmonary hypoplasia (cause of death).

Causes include ARPKD, obstructive uropathy (eg, posterior urethral valves), bilateral renal agenesis, chronic placental insufficiency.

Glucose clearance Glucose at a normal plasma level (range 60–120 mg/dL) is completely reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) by Na+/glucose cotransport. In adults, at plasma glucose of ∼ 200 mg/dL, glucosuria begins (threshold). At rate of ∼ 375 mg/min, all transporters are fully saturated (Tm). Normal pregnancy is associated with  GFR. With  filtration of all substances, including glucose, the glucose threshold occurs at lower plasma glucose concentrations  glucosuria at normal plasma glucose levels. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (eg, -flozin drugs) result in glucosuria at plasma concentrations < 200 mg/dL.

Glucosuria is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.

Splay phenomenon—Tm for glucose is reached gradually rather than sharply due to the heterogeneity of nephrons (ie, different Tm points); represented by the portion of the titration curve between threshold and T .

Early PCT—contains brush border. Reabsorbs all glucose and amino acids and most HCO3–, Na+, Cl–, PO43–, K+, H2O, and uric acid. Isotonic absorption. Generates and secretes NH3, which enables the kidney to secrete more H+.

The reproductive system can be intimidating at first but is manageable once you organize the concepts into the pregnancy, endocrinologic, embryologic, and oncologic aspects of reproduction. Study the endocrine and reproductive chapters together, because mastery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is key to answering questions on ovulation, menstruation, disorders of sexual development, contraception, and many pathologies.

Embryology is a nuanced subject that covers multiple organ systems. Approaching it from a clinical perspective will allow for better understanding. For instance, make the connection between the presentation of DiGeorge syndrome and the 3rd/4th pharyngeal pouch, and between the Müllerian/Wolffian systems and disorders of sexual development.

As for oncology, don’t worry about remembering screening or treatment guidelines. It is more important to know how these cancers present (eg, signs and symptoms) and their associated labs, histopathology, and risk factors. In addition, some of the testicular and ovarian cancers have distinct patterns of hCG, AFP, LH, or FSH derangements that serve as helpful clues in exam questions.

Important genes of embryogenesis

Types of errors in morphogenesis

Deformation Extrinsic disruption (eg, multiple gestations  crowding  foot deformities); occurs after embryonic period.

Malformation Intrinsic disruption; occurs during embryonic period (weeks 3–8).

Sequence Abnormalities result from a single 1° embryologic event (eg, oligohydramnios  Potter sequence).

Teratogens Most susceptible in 3rd–8th weeks (embryonic period—organogenesis) of pregnancy. Before week 3, “all-or-none” effects. After week 8, growth and function affected.

ACE inhibitors Renal failure, oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria.

Lithium Ebstein anomaly.

Methimazole Aplasia cutis congenita (congenital absence of skin, particularly on scalp).

Alcohol Fetal alcohol syndrome.

Iodine (lack or excess) Congenital goiter or hypothyroidism (cretinism).

Maternal diabetes Caudal regression syndrome, cardiac defects (eg, VSD), neural tube defects, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia (due to islet cell hyperplasia), polycythemia.

Methylmercury Neurotoxicity. Highest in swordfish, shark, tilefish, king mackerel.

Vitamin A excess Extremely high risk for spontaneous abortions and birth defects (cleft palate, cardiac).

Twinning Dizygotic (“fraternal”) twins arise from 2 eggs that are separately fertilized by 2 different sperm (always 2 zygotes) and will have 2 separate amniotic sacs and 2 separate placentas (chorions).

Monozygotic (“identical”) twins arise from 1 fertilized egg (1 egg + 1 sperm) that splits in early pregnancy. The timing of cleavage determines chorionicity (number of chorions) and amnionicity (number of amnions) (SCAB):

Cleavage 0–4 days: Separate chorion and amnion

Cleavage 4–8 days: shared Chorion

Cleavage 8–12 days: shared Amnion

Cleavage 13+ days: shared Body (conjoined) 2 eggs, 1 egg, 1 sperm 2 sperm

Pregnancy Fertilization most commonly occurs in upper end of fallopian tube (the ampulla). Occurs within 1 day of ovulation.

Implantation within the wall of the uterus occurs 6 days after fertilization.

Syncytiotrophoblasts secrete hCG, which is conception. Gestational age—calculated from date of last menstrual period.

Physiologic adaptations in pregnancy:

Weeks of pregnancy •  GFR  BUN and creatinine, Placental hormone secretion generally increases  glucosuria threshold over the course of pregnancy, but hCG peaks at • • cardiac output (• preload,  afterload, 8–10 weeks.

Anemia ( plasma, • RBCs) •  lipolysis and fat utilization (due to maternal hypoglycemia and insulin resistance)  preserves glucose and amino acids for utilization by the fetus

SOURCE Syncytiotrophoblast of placenta. FUNCTION Maintains corpus luteum (and thus progesterone) for first 8–10 weeks of pregnancy by acting like LH (otherwise no luteal cell stimulation  abortion). After 8–10 weeks, placenta synthesizes its own estriol and progesterone and corpus luteum degenerates. Used to detect pregnancy because it appears early in urine (see above). Has identical α subunit as LH, FSH, TSH (states of  hCG can cause hyperthyroidism). β subunit is unique (pregnancy tests detect β subunit). hCG is  in multiple gestations, hydatidiform moles, choriocarcinomas, and Down syndrome; hCG is  in ectopic/failing pregnancy, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome.

Human placental Also called chorionic somatomammotropin. lactogen

SOURCE Syncytiotrophoblast of placenta.

FUNCTION Stimulates insulin production; overall  insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes can occur if maternal pancreatic function cannot overcome the insulin resistance.

Assessment of newborn vital signs following delivery via a 10-point scale evaluated at 1 minute and 5 minutes. Apgar score is based on Appearance, Pulse, Grimace,

Activity, and Respiration. Apgar scores < 7 may require further evaluation. If Apgar score remains low at later time points, there is  risk the child will develop long-term neurologic damage.

Milestone dates are ranges that have been approximated and vary by source. Children not meeting milestones may need assessment for potential developmental delay.

Lactation After parturition and delivery of placenta, rapid  in progesterone disinhibits prolactin • initiation of lactation. Suckling is required to maintain milk production and ejection, since  nerve stimulation  oxytocin and prolactin. Prolactin—induces and maintains lactation and  reproductive function. Oxytocin—assists in milk letdown; also promotes uterine contractions. Breast milk is the ideal nutrition for infants < 6 months old. Contains maternal immunoglobulins (conferring passive immunity; mostly IgA), macrophages, lymphocytes. Breast milk reduces infant infections and is associated with  risk for child to develop asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Guidelines recommend exclusively breastfed infants get vitamin D and possibly iron supplementation. Breastfeeding  maternal risk of breast and ovarian cancer and facilitates mother-child bonding.

Menopause Diagnosed by amenorrhea for 12 months.

• estrogen production due to age-linked decline in number of ovarian follicles. Average age at onset is 51 years (earlier in smokers).

Usually preceded by 4–5 years of abnormal menstrual cycles. Source of estrogen (estrone) after menopause becomes peripheral conversion of androgens,  androgens  hirsutism.

 FSH is specific for menopause (loss of negative feedback on FSH due to  estrogen).

Hormonal changes:  estrogen,  FSH,  LH (no surge),  GnRH.

Causes HAVOCS: Hot flashes, Atrophy of the Vagina, Osteoporosis, Coronary artery disease, Sleep disturbances.

Menopause before age 40 suggests 1° ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure); may occur in women who have received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Androgens Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione.

SOURCE DHT and testosterone (testis), AnDrostenedione Potency: DHT > testosterone > (ADrenal) androstenedione.

FUNCTION Testosterone:

Differentiation of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles (internal genitalia, except prostate)

Growth spurt: penis, seminal vesicles, sperm, muscle, RBCs

Deepening of voice

Closing of epiphyseal plates (via estrogen converted from testosterone)

Libido DHT:

Early—differentiation of penis, scrotum, prostate

Late—prostate growth, balding, sebaceous gland activity

Testosterone is converted to DHT by 5α-reductase, which is inhibited by finasteride.

In the male, androgens are converted to estrogen by cytochrome P-450 aromatase (primarily in adipose tissue and testis).

Aromatase is the key enzyme in conversion of androgens to estrogen.

Conducting zone Large airways consist of nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Airway resistance highest in the largeto medium-sized bronchi. Small airways consist of bronchioles that further divide into terminal bronchioles (large numbers in parallel  least airway resistance).

Warms, humidifies, and filters air but does not participate in gas exchange  “anatomic dead space.” Cartilage and goblet cells extend to the end of bronchi. Pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells primarily make up epithelium of bronchus and extend to beginning of terminal bronchioles, then transition to cuboidal cells. Clear mucus and debris from lungs (mucociliary escalator). Airway smooth muscle cells extend to end of terminal bronchioles (sparse beyond this point).

Respiratory zone Lung parenchyma; consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Participates in gas exchange.

Right lung has 3 lobes; Left has Less Lobes (2) and Lingula (homolog of right middle lobe). Instead of a middle lobe, left lung has a space occupied by the heart A .

Relation of the pulmonary artery to the bronchus at each lung hilum is described by RALS—Right Anterior; Left Superior. Carina is posterior to ascending aorta and anteromedial to descending aorta B .

Right lung is a more common site for inhaled foreign bodies because right main stem bronchus is wider, more vertical, and shorter than the left. If you aspirate a peanut:

While supine—usually enters superior segment of right lower lobe.

While lying on right side—usually enters right upper lobe.

While upright—usually enters right lower lobe.

Tidal volume Air that moves into lung with each quiet inspiration, typically 500 mL 2.7 2.2 1.2 FRC

Determination of physiologic dead space

VD = physiologic dead space = anatomic dead space of conducting airways plus alveolar dead space; apex of healthy lung is largest contributor of alveolar dead space. Volume of inspired air that does not take part in gas exchange.

VT = tidal volume. Paco2 = arterial Pco2. Peco = expired air Pco 2 2.

Taco, Paco, Peco, Paco (refers to order of variables in equation)

Physiologic dead space—approximately equivalent to anatomic dead space in normal lungs. May be greater than anatomic dead space in lung diseases with V˙/Q˙ defects.

Minute ventilation Total volume of gas entering lungs per minute Normal values: VE = VT × RR Respiratory rate (RR) = 12–20 breaths/min

Alveolar ventilation Volume of gas that reaches alveoli each minute T V = 150 mL/breath

Elastic recoil Tendency for lungs to collapse inward and chest wall to spring outward.

At FRC, airway and alveolar pressures equal atmospheric pressure (called zero), and intrapleural pressure is negative (preventing atelectasis). The inward pull of the lung is balanced by the outward pull of the chest wall. System pressure is atmospheric. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is at a minimum.

Compliance Change in lung volume for a change in pressure (ΔV/ΔP). Inversely proportional to wall stiffness and increased by surfactant. 6 •  compliance = lung easier to fill (eg, emphysema, aging) •  compliance = lung harder to fill (eg, 4 pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema)

Hysteresis Lung inflation follows a different pressure-2 volume curve than lung deflation due to need to overcome surface tension forces in inflation.

Hemoglobin Oxygen content of blood

O2 content = (1.34 × Hb × Sao2) + (0.003 × Pao2) Hb = hemoglobin concentration; Sao2 = arterial O2 saturation Pao2 = partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood

Normally 1 g Hb can bind 1.34 mL O2; normal Hb amount in blood is 15 g/dL. O2 binding capacity ≈ 20 mL O2/dL of blood. With  Hb there is  O2 content of arterial blood, but no change in O2 saturation and Pao2. O2 delivery to tissues = cardiac output × O2 content of blood.

ODC has sigmoidal shape due to positive cooperativity (ie, tetrameric Hb molecule can 100 bind 4 O2 molecules and has higher affinity for each subsequent O2 molecule bound). 80 Myoglobin is monomeric and thus does 70 not show positive cooperativity; curve lacks 60 sigmoidal appearance.

Shifting ODC to the left  O2 unloading compensatory erythrocytosis.

Fetal Hb (2 α and 2 γ subunits) has higher affinity for O2 than adult Hb (due to  affinity for 2,3-BPG)  dissociation curve is shifted left, driving diffusion of O2 across the placenta from mother to fetus.

Cyanide vs carbon Both inhibit aerobic metabolism via inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)  hypoxia monoxide poisoning that does not fully correct with supplemental O2 and  anaerobic metabolism.

Both can lead to pink or cherry red skin (usually postmortem finding), seizures, and coma.

O2 bound to Hb (mL O2 /100 mL)

Normally a low-resistance, high-compliance system. A  in Pao2 causes a hypoxic vasoconstriction that shifts blood away from poorly ventilated regions of lung to well-ventilated regions of lung.

Perfusion limited—O2 (normal health), CO2, N2O. Gas equilibrates early along the length of the capillary. Exchange can be  only if blood flow .

Diffusion limited—O2 (emphysema, fibrosis, exercise), CO. Gas does not equilibrate by the time blood reaches the end of the capillary.

A consequence of pulmonary hypertension is cor pulmonale and subsequent right ventricular failure.

P – P Diffusion: V˙ gas = A × Dk × 1 2 where Δ

A = area, Δ x = alveolar wall thickness,  Dk = diffusion coefficient of gas, P1 – P2 = difference in partial pressures.

A  in emphysema.

Δ x  in pulmonary fibrosis.

DLCO is the extent to which CO passes from air sacs of lungs into blood.

Ventilation/perfusion Ideally, ventilation is matched to perfusion (ie, mismatch V˙/Q˙ = 1) for adequate gas exchange. Lung zones:

V˙/Q˙ at apex of lung = 3 (wasted ventilation) Q

V˙/Q˙ at base of lung = 0.6 (wasted perfusion) Both ventilation and perfusion are greater at the base of the lung than at the apex of the lung.

With exercise ( cardiac output), there is vasodilation of apical capillaries  V˙/Q˙ ratio approaches 1.

Certain organisms that thrive in high O2 (eg, TB) flourish in the apex.

V ˜˜ V˙/Q˙ = 0 = “oirway” obstruction (shunt). In Q shunt, 100% O2 does not improve Pao2 (eg, foreign body aspiration). V˙/Q˙ = ∞ = blood flow obstruction (physiologic dead space). Assuming < 100% dead space, 100% O2 improves Pao2 (eg, pulmonary embolus).

CO2 is transported from tissues to lungs in 3 forms: HCO3 − (70%). Carbaminohemoglobin or HbCO2 (21–25%). CO2 bound to Hb at N-terminus of globin (not heme). CO2 favors deoxygenated form (O2 unloaded). Dissolved CO2 (5–9%).

In lungs, oxygenation of Hb promotes dissociation of H+ from Hb. This shifts equilibrium toward CO2 formation; therefore, CO2 is released from RBCs (Haldane effect).

In peripheral tissue,  H+ from tissue metabolism shifts curve to right, unloading O2 (Bohr effect).

Majority of blood CO2 is carried as HCO3 − in the plasma.

Obstruction of sinus drainage into nasal cavity  inflammation and pain over affected area. Typically affects maxillary sinuses, which drain against gravity due to ostia located superomedially (red arrow points to fluid-filled right maxillary sinus in A ).

Superior meatus—drains sphenoid, posterior ethmoid; middle meatus—drains frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid; inferior meatus—drains nasolacrimal duct.

Most common acute cause is viral URI; may lead to superimposed bacterial infection, most commonly H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis.

Paranasal sinus infections may extend to the orbits, cavernous sinus, and brain, causing complications (eg, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus syndrome, meningitis).

Head and neck cancer Mostly squamous cell carcinoma. Risk factors include tobacco, alcohol, HPV-16 (oropharyngeal), EBV (nasopharyngeal). Field cancerization: carcinogen damages wide mucosal area • multiple tumors that develop independently after exposure.

Pulmonary emboli V˙/Q˙ mismatch, hypoxemia, respiratory alkalosis. Sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia. Large emboli or saddle embolus A may cause sudden death due to electromechanical dissociation (pulseless electrical activity). CT pulmonary angiography is imaging test of choice for PE (look for filling defects) B . May have S1Q3T3 abnormality on ECG. Lines of Zahn C are interdigitating areas of pink (platelets, fibrin) and red (RBCs) found only in thrombi formed before death; help distinguish preand postmortem thrombi. Types: Fat, Air, Thrombus, Bacteria, Amniotic fluid, Tumor. An embolus moves like a FAT BAT. Fat emboli—associated with long bone fractures and liposuction; classic triad of hypoxemia, neurologic abnormalities, petechial rash.

Embryology, and Neuroscience 715

This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample examination books, software, websites, and apps that have been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First Author (or editor), the Current Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Number of Pages, the Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.

For a complete list of resources, including summaries that describe their overall style and utility, go to www.firstaidteam.com/bonus

A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as follows:

The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including:

The cost

The readability of the text or usability of the app

The appropriateness and accuracy of the material

The quality and number of sample questions

The quality of written answers to sample questions

The quality and appropriateness of the illustrations (eg, graphs, diagrams, photographs)

The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)

The quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline

The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1

Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks available in the basic sciences.

Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the country. The ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited student feedback on any particular resource.

Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:

Publishers’ prices change frequently.

Bookstores often charge an additional markup.

New editions come out frequently, and the quality of updating varies.

The same book may be reissued through another publisher.

We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update our database. (See p. xvii, How to Contribute.) In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews of new books or suggestions for alternate modes of study that may be useful in preparing for the examination, such as flash cards, computer software, commercial review courses, apps, and websites.

Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement

No material in this book, including the ratings, reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention of the authors through our blog at www.firstaidteam.com.

Please note that USMLE-Rx and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series are publications by certain authors of this book; the following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student authors of this book as well as data from the student survey and feedback forms.
