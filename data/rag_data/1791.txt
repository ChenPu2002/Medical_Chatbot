tuberculosis	is a	bacterial infection
tuberculosis	can affect	various organs
extrapulmonary tuberculosis	is a form of	tuberculosis
tuberculosis	can affect	the lungs
tuberculosis	is transmitted through	respiratory droplets
tuberculosis	is diagnosed by	bacteriological or histological examination
bacteriological examination	involves	culturing and identifying the bacteria
histological examination	involves	examining tissue samples under a microscope
tuberculosis of other specified organs	refers to	specific organ involvement
organ involvement	can vary	depending on the site
bacteriological or histological examination not done	indicates	lack of specific test results
tuberculosis	can cause	symptoms such as cough	fever	and weight loss
tuberculosis	can lead to	complications such as lung damage	meningitis	and bone infections
tuberculosis	is treated with	a combination of antibiotics
antibiotics	are medications that	kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria
tuberculosis	treatment usually involves	a combination of isoniazid	rifampin	ethambutol	and pyrazinamide
isoniazid	is a	tuberculosis medication
rifampin	is another	tuberculosis medication
ethambutol	is a	tuberculosis medication
pyrazinamide	is a	tuberculosis medication
tuberculosis	treatment may last	for several months
tuberculosis	can be cured	with appropriate treatment
tuberculosis	is a	major global health problem
tuberculosis	is more common in	developing countries and among individuals with weakened immune systems
mortality	can occur	in severe cases of tuberculosis
tuberculosis	can lead to	hospitalization
tuberculosis	can result in	long-term healthcare costs
tuberculosis	can cause	disability and loss of productivity
tuberculosis	can be prevented	through vaccination with the BCG vaccine
BCG vaccine	is a	vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis
tuberculosis	can be prevented	through infection control measures such as wearing masks and practicing good hygiene
tuberculosis	is a	reportable disease
tuberculosis	requires	contact tracing and monitoring of close contacts
tuberculosis	is a	notifiable disease
tuberculosis	control programs	aim to	detect and treat cases	and prevent transmission
tuberculosis	can be	drug-resistant
tuberculosis	drug resistance	is a major concern for treatment
tuberculosis	drug resistance	can be	multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	is resistant to	at least isoniazid and rifampin
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	is resistant to	isoniazid	rifampin	fluoroquinolones	and at least one second-line injectable medication
tuberculosis	drug resistance	is diagnosed through	drug susceptibility testing
drug susceptibility testing	determines	the drugs to which the bacteria is sensitive or resistant
tuberculosis	drug resistance	requires	alternative treatment regimens
tuberculosis	is a	public health concern
tuberculosis	control measures	involve	early detection	treatment initiation	and infection control
tuberculosis	prevention	includes	vaccination	contact tracing	and screening high-risk populations
tuberculosis	is a	notifiable disease
tuberculosis	surveillance	is important for monitoring disease trends and evaluating control measures
tuberculosis	can be	recurrent
tuberculosis	recurrence	may indicate	treatment failure or reinfection
tuberculosis	recurrence	requires	evaluation and adjustment of treatment plan
tuberculosis	can be	life-threatening
tuberculosis	can lead to	complications such as respiratory failure and disseminated disease
tuberculosis	mortality	can be	reduced with prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment
tuberculosis	can cause	social stigma and discrimination
tuberculosis	stigma	can result in	delayed diagnosis and treatment
tuberculosis	education and awareness	are important to reduce stigma
tuberculosis	research	is ongoing to develop new diagnostic tools and more effective treatments
tuberculosis	elimination	remains a global health goal
tuberculosis	elimination	involves	reducing disease transmission	improving access to diagnosis and treatment	and addressing social determinants of health
