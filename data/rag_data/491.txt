meningitis	is caused by	adenovirus
meningitis	can lead to	fever
meningitis	may cause	headache
meningitis	requires	hospitalization
meningitis	can be treated with	antiviral medication
adenovirus	can cause	respiratory infection
adenovirus	is transmitted through	respiratory droplets
adenovirus	can lead to	conjunctivitis
fever	can be treated with	acetaminophen
headache	can be relieved by	over-the-counter pain relievers
hospitalization	is needed for	intravenous treatment
antiviral medication	is effective against	adenovirus
respiratory infection	can be prevented with	good hygiene practices
respiratory droplets	are produced when	an infected person coughs or sneezes
conjunctivitis	can be diagnosed by	examining the eyes
acetaminophen	is a	fever reducer
over-the-counter pain relievers	can help alleviate	headache
intravenous treatment	requires	hospital admission
good hygiene practices	include	washing hands regularly
an infected person	should cover their mouth and nose when	coughing or sneezing
eyes	can become red and swollen when	infected with adenovirus
fever reducer	can be taken orally or rectally
headache	can be caused by	inflammation
hospital admission	may be necessary for	monitoring and intensive care
hand hygiene	plays a key role in	preventing viral infections
coughing or sneezing	can spread adenovirus to	nearby individuals
conjunctivitis	can be treated with	eye drops
anti-inflammatory drugs	can help reduce	headache
monitoring and intensive care	are important for	ensuring prompt treatment
viral infections	can be prevented by	vaccines
adherence to medications	is crucial for	successful treatment
eye drops	can help relieve	eye discomfort
vaccines	are available to protect against	adenovirus
successful treatment	depends on	early diagnosis and intervention
eye discomfort	can be caused by	redness and irritation
early diagnosis and intervention	improve	prognosis
redness and irritation	can be alleviated with	artificial tears
adenovirus infection	can result in	severe complications
artificial tears	provide temporary relief for	dry eyes
prognosis	is influenced by	the severity of the infection
dry eyes	may also be caused by	adenovirus infection
severe complications	require	specialized medical care
severity of the infection	can be assessed by	laboratory tests
specialized medical care	is necessary for	managing complications
laboratory tests	can detect	adenovirus DNA
adenovirus DNA	is present in	infected individuals
laboratory tests	play a crucial role in	diagnosing adenovirus meningitis
managing complications	may involve	surgical intervention
infected individuals	should isolate themselves to	prevent spreading the virus
diagnosing adenovirus meningitis	helps guide	treatment decisions
surgical intervention	may be necessary to	treat complications
prevent spreading the virus	by avoiding close contact with	others
treatment decisions	should be based on	individual patient characteristics
complications	can include	brain damage
individual patient characteristics	should be considered when	determining the appropriate treatment
brain damage	can result in	long-term neurological impairments
long-term neurological impairments	can significantly impact	quality of life
